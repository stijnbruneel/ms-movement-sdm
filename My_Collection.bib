abstract = {Low relief oceanic islands often suffer from scarcity of freshwater resources. Remote sensing has proved to be an effective tool to generate valuable data for hydrological analysis and has improved the management of ecosystems and water. However, remotely sensed data are often tested over areas with existing validation databases and not always where the need is greatest. In this paper we address the need for topographical data to understand the hydrological system of Santa Cruz Island (Galapagos archipelago) so that management of freshwater ecosystems and resources can take place. No high resolution, high accuracy topographical data exist for Santa Cruz Island, and its growing population has created an urgent need for water resource management and protection of unique and pristine ecosystems. Inaccessible National Park land covers more than 97{\%} of Galapagos territory, which makes the use of remote sensing methods indispensable. SRTM data was insufficient in terms of grid size (90 m) to carry out the needed data analysis. We used ASAR data (ENVISAT) in VV polarization image mode for Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation, in order to extract drainage network, watersheds, and flow characteristics from a morpho-structural analysis. Results show the high potential of these data for both interferometric and radargrammetric generation methods. Although interferometry suffered from low coherence over highly vegetated areas, it showed high precision over the rest of the island. Radargrammetry gave consistent results over the entire island, and details were enhanced by integrating the 90 m SRTM data as an external DEM. Accuracy of the SRTM and the combined radargrammetric/SRTM DEM was similar, with the radargrammetric having a finer pixel-based resolution (20 m). Validation of the extracted drainage networks and watersheds was carried out using ground-based field observations and comparison to mapped river networks visually extracted from aerial photographs and high resolution (1 m) satellite imagery available on GoogleEarth{\textcopyright}. For the first time, watershed characteristics and flow paths were made available for an island of the Galapagos archipelago. Furthermore, the drainage network is shown to be strongly influenced by observed and extracted structural discontinuities. Having characterized freshwater flow, water balance calculations were carried out for Pelican Bay watershed, where urban areas, agricultural land and Galapagos National Park land are concomitant. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {1. Climate change impacts have been observed on individual species and species subsets; however, it remains to be seen whether there are systematic, coherent assemblage-wide responses to climate change that could be used as a representative indicator of changing biological state. 2. European shelf seas are warming faster than the adjacent land masses and faster than the global average. We explore the year-by-year distributional response of North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fishes to temperature change over the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The centres of latitudinal and depth distributions of 28 fishes were estimated from species-abundance–location data collected on an annual fish monitoring survey. 3. Individual species responses were aggregated into 19 assemblages reflecting physiology (thermal preference and range), ecology (body size and abundance-occupancy patterns), biogeography (northern, southern and presence of range boundaries), and susceptibility to human impact (fishery target, bycatch and non-target species). 4. North Sea winter bottom temperature has increased by 1{\textperiodcentered}6 ° C over 25 years, with a 1 ° C increase in 1988–1989 alone. During this period, the whole demersal fish assemblage deepened by {\~{}}3{\textperiodcentered}6 m decade –1 and the deepening was coherent for most assemblages. 5. The latitudinal response to warming was heterogeneous, and reflects (i) a northward shift in the mean latitude of abundant, widespread thermal specialists, and (ii) the southward shift of relatively small, abundant southerly species with limited occupancy and a northern range boundary in the North Sea. 6. Synthesis and applications. The deepening of North Sea bottom-dwelling fishes in response to climate change is the marine analogue of the upward movement of terrestrial species to higher altitudes. The assemblage-level depth responses, and both latitudinal responses, covary with temperature and environmental variability in a manner diagnostic of a climate change impact. The deepening of the demersal fish assemblage in response to temperature could be used as a biotic indicator of the effects of climate change in the North Sea and other semi-enclosed seas.},

abstract = {We studied forest structure, composition and tree species diversity of eight plots in an environmental matrix of four altitudes (700, 1700, 2700 and 3100 m) and two types of geological substrates (ultrabasic and non-ultrabasic rocks) on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. On both substrate series, forest stature, mean leaf area and tree species diversity (both greater than or equal to 4.8 cm and greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]) decreased with altitude. The two forests on the different substrate series were similar at 700 m in structure, generic and familial composition and tree species diversity, but became dissimilar with increasing altitude. The decline in stature with altitude was steeper on the ultrabasic substrates than on the non-ultrabasic substrates, and tree species diversity was generally lower on ultrabasic substrates than on non-ultrabasic substrates at greater than or equal to 1700 m. The forests on non-ultrabasic substrates at higher altitudes and those on ultrabasic substrates at the lower altitudes were similar in dbh versus tree height allometry, mean leaf area, and generic and familial composition at greater than or equal to 1700 m. These contrasting patterns in forest structure and composition between the two substrate series suggested that altitudinal change was compressed on the ultrabasic substrates compared to the non-ultrabasic substrates. Tree species diversity was correlated with maximum tree height and estimated aboveground biomass, but was not with basal area, among the eight study sites. We suggest that forests with higher tree species diversity are characterized by greater biomass allocation to height growth relative to trunk diameter growth under more productive environment than forests with lower tree species diversity.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are important sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor of ozone. In tropical montane forests nitrogen limitation is common which affects both soil N2O and NO fluxes and forest productivity. Here we present evidence that forest productivity and N-oxide (N2O+ NO) fluxes are linked through N availability along elevation and topographic gradients in tropical montane forests. We measured N-oxide fluxes, several indices of N availability, and forest productivity along an elevation gradient from 1000 m to 3000 m and along topographic gradients. Organic layer thickness of the soils increased and N availability decreased with increasing elevation and along the topographic gradient from the lower slope position to the ridges. Annual N2O fluxes ranged from ?0.53 mg(N)m?2h?1 to 14.54 mg(N)m?2h?1 while NO fluxes ranged from ?0.02 mg(N)m?2h?1 to 1.13 mg(N)m?2h?1. Both N-oxide fluxes and forest productivity increased with increasingN availability and showed close positive correlations with indices of N availability (C/N ratio and d 15N signature of litterfall). We interpret the close correlations of N-oxide fluxes with total litterfall and tree basal area increment as evidence that N availability links N-oxide fluxes and forest productivity. This opens the possibility to include forest productivity as co-variable in predictions of N-oxide fluxes in nitrogen limited tropical montane forests. Especially increment of tree basal area was a promising proxy to predict soil N-oxide fluxes in these N limited ecosystems, possibly because it better reflects long-term forest productivity than total litterfall.},

Such phenomena are best simulated with unstructured grid models due to their highly flexible spatial discretisation. This article presents a three-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin finite element marine model. Discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretisation is combined with an explicit mode splitting time integration scheme. Slope limiters are introduced to guarantee high quality of the tracer fields in the presence of strong gradients. Free surface movement is accounted for by means of an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) moving mesh method. Water volume and tracers are conserved. The conservation properties and baroclinic adjustment under gravity are tested with numerical benchmarks. Finally, the model is applied to the Rhine river plume in an idealised setting.

abstract = {To study retention of waterborn larvae in a reef matrix we used a finite-element unstructured numerical model with a minimum horizontal resolution of 150 m that can capture variability of currents on a spatial scale relevant to coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Areas of high reef density (i.e. closely aggregated reefs) are poorly flushed because the prevailing currents are directed around and away from these regions, which is an oceanographic process called the 'sticky water' effect. The model showed that the sticky water effect leads to decreased flushing and a high exposure time in high reef density areas in the southern and central regions of the GBR matrix. In turn this generated hot spots of high self-seeding, and these hot spots existed under both calm weather conditions and wind conditions typical of those during the coral spawning season. Away from these areas, self-seeding was less likely to occur and larval replenishment would result mainly from connectivity between reefs located kilometres to tens of kilometres apart. The location of sticky water areas varied spatially within the reef matrix according to tidal and mean currents, local bathymetry and reef density (defined as the degree of aggregation by reefs). A simple analytical formula is presented that explains {\~{}}70{\%} of the variation in larval retention in both calm weather and windy conditions. Complex reef mosaics and the related sticky water effect may have significant implications on the fate of larvae, and thus on connectivity for coral reefs worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Discriminating marine fish assemblages at broad scales can be difficult because of heterogeneity within their habitats, variability in patterns of behaviour and abundance of fish between habitats, and sampling biases in extractive fishing techniques when used across a range of habitats. Remote underwater video stations have recently been developed to help overcome these problems, but the use of bait as an attractant raises questions about bias towards scavengers and predators in samples of fish communities. We compared the ability of baited and unbaited underwater video stations to discriminate between fish assemblages inhabiting distinct benthic habitats in temperate and tropical continental shelf waters in Australia, to help test whether the bait attracted predatory and scavenging species to the video in disproportionate numbers in comparison to other trophic groups, such as herbivores. Data from baited video cameras displayed a clearer discrimination in constrained canonical analysis of principal coordinates of fish assemblages between marine habitats in both tropical and temperate environments. Analysis of the key trophic groups indicated that bait attracted greater numbers of predatory and scavenging species without decreasing the abundances of herbivorous or omnivorous fishes. There was greater similarity between replicate samples from baited video within habitats, implying that the use of bait will provide better statistical power to detect spatial and temporal changes in the structure of fish assemblages and the relative abundances of individual species within them.},

abstract = {Revenue from carbon credits from rainforest stands could encourage reforestation for biodiversity conservation on private land in north-eastern Queensland, Australia. Current models and allometrics for estimating carbon, however, are not calibrated against sites in the region and underestimate carbon stocks. We assess the accuracy of the two accepted methods to estimate carbon stocks in Australian rainforests: FullCAM and the Keith et al. (2000) allometric. We also assess the effect of FullCAM's discounting of small stems (2.5-10cm) to carbon stocks, and compare the carbon benefits of the three reforestation methods in the region to identify planting configurations with the best carbon sequestration potential. We sampled 27 rainforest stands in north-eastern Queensland. Using these data we calculated above-ground biomass (AGB) using the Keith allometric and derived the above-ground carbon (AGC). We compared our estimates across three reforestation methods with the FullCAM modelled estimates for the same sites, and with estimates derived from two global rainforest allometrics (Brown, 1997; Chave et al., 2005). The Keith allometric estimated that planted forests yielded on average 20Mg of tradable carbon ha -1y -1 (i.e. CO 2-equivalent), with no differences between plantation forests and environmental plantings, although the former had more large diameter stems. Small stems ({\textless}10cm) accounted for 15.1{\%} of AGB in plantings {\textless}20years old. However, even excluding these, the estimates using the Keith allometric were 19.5{\%} greater than those of FullCAM; the Chave allometric 40.4{\%} greater; and the Brown allometric 54.9{\%} greater. More thorough forest mensuration using actual tree volumes and densities is required to determine a biomass allometric function for rainforests in the region. Until then, we recommend the Chave allometric function. It provides intermediate values, is based on the widest range of tropical trees and has been shown to be accurate away from the sites used for its development. This study demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods for estimating carbon stocks in rainforest plantings in north-eastern Queensland. A tailored allometric and the re-parameterisation of FullCAM is needed to reflect both the region's environmental characteristics and the vegetation structure of young reforestation stands. Current estimates deprive landholders of financial incentives and underestimate the national greenhouse gas benefits of tree planting in the Wet Tropics. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The net primary production of tropical forests and its partitioning between long-lived carbon pools (wood) and shorter-lived pools (leaves, fine roots) are of considerable importance in the global carbon cycle. However, these terms have only been studied at a handful of field sites, and with no consistent calculation methodology. Here we calculate above-ground coarse wood carbon productivity for 104 forest plots in lowland New World humid tropical forests, using a consistent calculation methodology that incorporates corrections for spatial variations in tree-size distributions and wood density, and for census interval length. Mean wood density is found to be lower in more productive forests. We estimate that above-ground coarse wood productivity varies by more than a factor of three (between 1.5 and 5.5 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1)) across the Neotropical plots, with a mean value of 3.1 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1). There appear to be no obvious relationships between wood productivity and rainfall, dry season length or sunshine, but there is some hint of increased productivity at lower temperatures. There is, however, also strong evidence for a positive relationship between wood productivity and soil fertility. Fertile soils tend to become more common towards the Andes and at slightly higher than average elevations, so the apparent temperature/productivity relationship is probably not a direct one. Coarse wood productivity accounts for only a fraction of overall tropical forest net primary productivity, but the available data indicate that it is approximately proportional to total above-ground productivity. We speculate that the large variation in wood productivity is unlikely to directly imply an equivalent variation in gross primary production. Instead a shifting balance in carbon allocation between respiration, wood carbon and fine root production seems the more likely explanation.},

The process equations that are introduced all require (reaction) rate parameters and a variety of common procedures for identifying those parameters are reviewed. This is important because there is a wide range of estimation techniques for many of the parameters. These different techniques elicit different estimates of the parameter value and so there is the potential for a significant uncertainty in the model's inputs and therefore in the output too.

abstract = {It is thought that some elasmobranchs use shallow temperate estuaries during warmer months because these habitats may provide thermal physiological advantages. However, extensive loss and degradation of southern California bays and estuaries has reduced coastal species access to estuarine habitats. While restoration of southern California estuaries has increased over the last two decades, little is known about the recovery of ecological function. Top predators are thought to be important indicators of restoration of ecological function in many ecosystems, including estuarine habitats. In this study, abundance surveys and acoustic telemetry were employed to examine how gray smooth-hound sharks (GSH) use the newly restored Full Tidal Basin (FTB) of Bolsa Chica. GSH were most abundant inside the FTB during the spring and summer, and numbers decreased during the winter. Over 83{\%} of all individuals (n = 336) caught were immature juveniles and were most abundant when water temperatures were between 20 and 22 °C. Sharks fitted with acoustic transmitters (n = 22) were continuously detected for 6-153. days (August 2008-December 2009). Forays into coastal waters were uncommon until individuals left for the season. GSH selected warmer habitats within the middle FTB; however, they also exhibited diel movements along the basin. GSH were most often found associated with mud and eelgrass at night, presumably for feeding. Since its restoration, population and behavioral data suggest that the FTB may provide juvenile GSH with a suitable seasonal environment for feeding and growth. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We analysed 1040 individual trees, located in 62 plots across the Amazon Basin for leaf mass per unit area (MA), foliar carbon isotopic composition (13C) and leaf level concentrations of C, N, P, Ca, Mg, K and Al. All trees were identified to the species level with the dataset containing 58 families, 236 genera and 508 species, distributed across a wide range of soil types and precipitation regimes. Some foliar characteristics such as MA, [C], [N] and [Mg] emerge as highly constrained by the taxonomic affiliation of tree species, but with others such as [P], [K], [Ca] and 13C also strongly influenced by site growing conditions. By removing the environmental contribution to trait varia- tion, we find that intrinsic values of most trait pairs coordinate, although different species (characterised by different trait suites) are found at discrete locations along a common axis of coordination. Species that tend to occupy higher fertility soils are characterised by a lowerMA and have a higher intrinsic [N], [P], [K], [Mg] and 13C than their lower fertility counterparts. Despite this consistency, different scaling patterns were observed between low and high fertility sites. Inter-relationships are thus substantially modified by growth environment. Analysing the environmental component of trait variation, we found soil fertility to be the most important predictor, influencing all leaf nutrient concentrations and 13C and reducing MA. Mean annual temperature was negatively associated with leaf level [N], [P] and [K] concentrations. Total annual precipitation positively influences MA, [C] and 13C, but with a negative impact on [Mg]. These results provide a first basis for understanding the relationship between the physiological functioning and distribution of tree species across Amazonia.},

abstract = {Estuaries are among the earth's most valuable and productive environmental resources. To further our understanding of the impact of human activities on estuaries, there is a need for appropriate statistical methods for analyzing estuarine data. Estuaries possess a number of features that must be considered during spatial data analyses. Estuaries are irregularly shaped non-convex regions. Therefore, Euclidean distance may not be an appropriate distance metric for spatial analyses of estuaries, especially if the line segment connecting two sites intercepts land. Furthermore, some environmental variables may take deterministic values at estuarine boundaries. For example, shorelines are saturated with dissolved oxygen, and the salinity at estuarine mouths should be close to that of the ocean. This paper considers methods for spatial modelling and prediction using different distance metrics, and under fixed boundary conditions. These methods are illustrated using data from Charleston Harbor, an estuary on the coast of South Carolina, USA 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Detection of species' populations in streams may be challenging because the persistence time for intact DNA fragments is unknown and because eDNA is diluted and dispersed by dynamic hydrological processes. During 2015, the DNA of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis was analyzed from water samples collected at 40 streams across the Adirondack region of upstate New York, where Brook Trout populations were recently quantified. Study objectives were to evaluate different sampling methods and the ability of eDNA to accurately predict the presence and abundance of resident Brook Trout populations.

abstract = {Over the last few decades, several modelling tools have been developed for the simulation of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. Until late 70's, coupling hydrodynamic models to biogeochemical models was not common and today, problems linked to the different scales of interest remain. The time scale of hydrodynamic phenomena in coastal zone (minutes to hours) is much lower than that of biogeochemistry (few days). Over the last years, there has been an increasing tendency to couple hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models in a clear recognition of the importance of incorporating in one model the feedbacks between physical, chemical and biological processes. However, different modelling teams tend to adopt different modelling tools, with the result that benchmarking exercises are sometimes difficult to achieve in projects involving several institutions. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to provide a quick overview of available modelling approaches for hydrodynamic and biogeochemical modelling, to help people choose among the diversity of available models, as a function of their particular needs, and to propose a unified approach to allow modellers to share software code, based on the object oriented programming potentiality. This approach is based on having object dynamic link libraries that may be linked to different model shells. Each object represents different processes and respective variables, e.g. hydrodynamic, phytoplankton and zooplankton objects. Some simple rules are proposed to link available objects to programs written in different source codes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study, we assessed the relationship between the occurrence of the invasive water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and water quality properties as well as macroinvertebrate diversity in a tropical reservoir, situated in western Ecuador. Macroinvertebrates and physico-chemical water quality variables were sampled at 32 locations (during the dry season of 2013) in both sites covered and non-covered by water hyacinth in the Daule-Peripa reservoir. The results indicated that, in terms of water quality, only turbidity was significantly different between sampling sites with and without water hyacinth (Mann–Whitney U-test, p{\textless}0.01). The habitat suitability model showed that water hyacinth was present at sites with a low turbidity. The percentage water hyacinth cover increased with decreasing turbidity. The Biological Monitoring Working Party-Colombia score and the Margalef diversity index were significantly higher (Mann–Whitney U-test, p{\textless}0.01) at sampling sites where water hyacinth was present compared to water hyacinth absent sites. However, there were no significant differences in the Shannon–Wiener index, Evenness index and Simpson index between the sampling sites with and without water hyacinth. Our results suggest that water hyacinth cover was an important variable affecting the diversity of macroinvertebrates in the Daule-Peripa reservoir, with intermediate levels of water hyacinth cover having a positive effect on the diversity of macroinvertebrates. Information on the habitat suitability of water hyacinth and its effect on the physico-chemical water quality and the macroinvertebrate community are essential to develop conservation and management programs for large tropical reservoirs such as the Daule-Peripa reservoir and the Guayas river basin, where water resources are being at high risk due to expansion of agricultural and industrial development activities.},

abstract = {Nutrient supply commonly limits aboveground plant productivity in forests, but the effects of an altered nutrient supply on gross primary production (GPP) and patterns of carbon (C) allocation remain poorly characterized. Increased nutrient supply may lead to a higher aboveground net primary production (ANPP), but a lower total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA), with little change in either aboveground plant respiration (APR) or GPP. Alternatively, increases in nutrient supply may increase GPP, with the quantity of GPP allocated aboveground increasing more steeply than the quantity of GPP allocated belowground. To examine the effects of an elevated nutrient supply on the C allocation patterns in forests, we determined whole-ecosystem C budgets in unfertilized plots of Eucalyptus saligna and in adjacent plots receiving regular additions of 65 kg N ha(-1), 31 kg P ha(-1), 46 kg K ha(-1), and macro- and micronutrients. We measured the absolute flux of C allocated to the components of GPP (ANPP, TBCA and APR), as well as the fraction of GPP allocated to these components. Fertilization dramatically increased GPP. Averaged over 3 years, GPP in the fertilized plots was 34{\%} higher than that in the unfertilized controls (3.95 vs. 2.95 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Fertilization-related increases in GPP were allocated entirely aboveground - ANPP was 85{\%} higher and APR was 57{\%} higher in the fertilized than in the control plots, while TBCA did not differ significantly between treatments. Carbon use efficiency (NPP/GPP) was slightly higher in the fertilized (0.53) compared with the control plots (0.51). Overall, fertilization increased ANPP and APR, and these increases were related to a greater GPP and an increase in the fraction of GPP allocated aboveground.},

In whole soil and particle-size fractions, the clover-derived N was always 85-90{\%} amide, 5-10{\%} guanidinium N of arginine, and 5{\%} amino. Quantitativeness of these results was suggested by (1) analysis of a standard containing a complex mixture of organic 15N and (2) correlation of spectral intensities with 15N concentrations. Based on the unchanging proteinaceous NMR signature of clover-derived N throughout the incubation, differences in the mineralization/immobilization kinetics of clover-N among the different particle-size fractions appeared not to be linked to organic functional group. Kinetic analysis of the mineralization of 15N, with correction of rate constants for field temperatures, suggested that the proteinanceous 15N in the clay and fine silt fractions observed here had a mean residence time of 7 years in the field. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An ecological niche modelling (ENM) approach was developed to model the suitable habitat for the 0-group European hake, Merluccius merluccius L., 1758, in the Mediterranean Sea. The ENM was built combining knowledge on biological traits of hake recruits (e.g. growth, settlement, mobility and feeding strategy) with patterns of selected ecological variables (chlorophyll-a fronts and concentration, bottom depth, sea bottom current and temperature) to highlight favourable nursery habitats. The results show that hake nurseries require stable bottom temperature (11.8-15.0°C), low bottom currents ({\textless}0.034ms-1) and a frequent occurrence of productive fronts in low chlorophyll-a areas (0.1-0.9mgm-3) to support a successful recruitment. These conditions mostly occur recurrently in outer shelf and shelf break areas. The prediction explains the relative balance between biotic and abiotic drivers of hake recruitment in the Mediterranean Sea and the primary role of unfavourable environmental conditions on low recruitment in specific years (i.e. 2011). The ENM outputs particularly agree spatially with biomass data of recruits, although processes such as fishing and natural mortality are not accounted for. The seasonal mapping of suitable habitats provides information on potential nurseries and recruitment carrying capacity which are relevant for spatial fisheries management of hake in the Mediterranean Sea.},

abstract = {Competition for light has profound effects on plant performance in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems. Nowhere is this more evident than in forests, where trees create environmental heterogeneity that shapes the dynamics of forest-floor communities. Observational evidence suggests that biotic responses to both anthropogenic global warming and nitrogen pollution may be attenuated by the shading effects of trees and shrubs. Here we show experimentally that tree shade is slowing down changes in below-canopy communities due to warming. We manipulated levels of photosynthetically active radiation, temperature and nitrogen, alone and in combination, in a temperate forest understorey over a 3-year period, and monitored the composition of the understorey community. Light addition, but not nitrogen enrichment, accelerated directional plant community responses to warming, increasing the dominance of warmth-preferring taxa over cold-tolerant plants (a process described as thermophilization). Tall, competitive plants took greatest advantage of the combination of elevated temperature and light. Warming of the forest floor did not result in strong community thermophilization unless light was also increased. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of locally closed canopy conditions could reduce, at least temporarily, warming-induced changes in forest floor plant communities.},

There is now increasing evidence that this very localized occurrence is caused by human activity, that chronic overgrazing and pasture management by burning has restricted the woody vegetation to particular habitats, and that these forests were once widespread and contiguous with lower elevation cloudforests. The human-induced vegetation changes were modest in the aird parts of the puna zone and some Polylepis patches persist remarkably well, probably because of active management by local communities. Comparison of current and modeled potential distribution of birds suggest and average reduction in species richness of 26{\%} in the humid parts of the puna zone and 17{\%} in montane basins of central Peru. The biologically most valuable areas are found close to ancient cultural centers in the Andes, possibly reflecting the fact that local climate is favorable for agriculture as well as for rare (relict) species of animals and plants. Because of this link, initiatives to minimize global extinction of animals and plants must include support for sustainable land use in these places, in addition to traditional conservation by formal reserving of wilderness areas with few people. New land management initiatives must provide realistic alternatives to extensive pastoralism based on regular burning, and must support reforestation by native trees.},

abstract = {During photosynthesis, CO2 moves from the atmosphere (C(a)) surrounding the leaf to the sub-stomatal internal cavities (C(i)) through stomata, and from there to the site of carboxylation inside the chloroplast stroma (C(c)) through the leaf mesophyll. The latter CO2 diffusion component is called mesophyll conductance (g(m)), and can be divided in at least three components, that is, conductance through intercellular air spaces (g(ias)), through cell wall (g(w)) and through the liquid phase inside cells (g(liq)). A large body of evidence has accumulated in the past two decades indicating that g(m) is sufficiently small as to significantly decrease C(c) relative to C(i), therefore limiting photosynthesis. Moreover, g(m) is not constant, and it changes among species and in response to environmental factors. In addition, there is now evidence that g(liq) and, in some cases, g(w), are the main determinants of g(m). Mesophyll conductance is very dynamic, changing in response to environmental variables as rapid or even faster than stomatal conductance (i.e. within seconds to minutes). A revision of current knowledge on g(m) is presented. Firstly, a historical perspective is given, highlighting the founding works and methods, followed by a re-examination of the range of variation of g(m) among plant species and functional groups, and a revision of the responses of g(m) to different external (biotic and abiotic) and internal (developmental, structural and metabolic) factors. The possible physiological bases for g(m), including aquaporins and carbonic anhydrases, are discussed. Possible ecological implications for variable g(m) are indicated, and the errors induced by neglecting g(m) when interpreting photosynthesis and carbon isotope discrimination models are highlighted. Finally, a series of research priorities for the near future are proposed.},

abstract = {High concentrations of nutrients from agricultural and urban runoff, or those produced by coastal upwelling, are causing algal blooms in many estuaries and coastal waters. Algal blooms induce eutrophic conditions, depleting oxygen levels needed by organic life, limiting aquatic plant growth by reducing water transparency, and producing toxins that can harm fish, benthic animals, and humans. The magnitude and frequency of phytoplankton blooms have increased globally in recent decades, as shown in data from ocean-color sensors on-board satellites. Satellite and airborne measurements of spectral reflectance (ocean color) represent an effective way for monitoring phytoplankton by its proxy, chlorophyll-a, the green pigment that is present in all algae. This article reviews the use of remote sensing techniques for detecting phytoplankton and mapping algal blooms. Two case studies are presented, illustrating the advantages and limitations of satellite and airborne remote sensing},

abstract = {The net primary productivity (NPP) of tropical forests is one of the most important and least quantified components of the global carbon cycle. Most relevant studies have focused particularly on the quantification of the above-ground coarse wood productivity, and little is known about the carbon fluxes involved in other elements of the NPP, the partitioning of total NPP between its above- and below-ground components and the main environmental drivers of these patterns. In this study we quantify the aboveand below-ground NPP of ten Amazonian forests to address two questions: (1) How do Amazonian forests allocate productivity among its above- and below-ground components? (2) How do soil and leaf nutrient status and soil texture affect the productivity of Amazonian forests? Using a standardized methodology to measure the major elements of productivity, we show that NPP varies between 9.3±1.3MgCha−1 yr−1 (mean±standard error), at a white sand plot, and 17.0±1.4MgCha−1 yr−1 at a very fertile Terra Preta site, with an overall average of 12.8±0.9MgCha−1 yr−1. The studiedforests allocate on average 64±3{\%} and 36±3{\%} of the total NPP to the above- and below-ground components, respectively. The ratio of above-ground and below-ground NPP is almost invariant with total NPP. Litterfall and fine root production both increase with total NPP, while stem production shows no overall trend. Total NPP tends to increase with soil phosphorus and leaf nitrogen status. However, allocation of NPP tobelow-ground shows no relationship to soil fertility, but appears to decrease with the increase of soil clay content.},

abstract = {Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) systems are being used in marine ecosystems as a nonextractive, cost-effective method of assessing the fish fauna with minimal species bias. This technique has had limited applications in freshwater ecosystems. Rheophilic fish assemblages of the Xingu River, a clearwater Amazonian river in Northern Brazil, were sampled with BRUV systems. Two-hour video recordings were collected using five different bait treatments (sardine, croaker, cat food, sweet corn, and no bait) in two lotic habitat categories (rocky and sandy bottoms). A total of 2460 fish from 56 taxa and 13 families were recorded from the 80 BRUV deployments. Significantly different fish assemblages, species richness, and abundance were detected between habitat types and among treatments. Our results suggest that the use of crushed sardines as a standardized bait optimizes the sampling recording the highest species richness, relative abundance, and number of exclusive species of rheophilic fish in clearwater Amazonian rivers. The data also highlight the unique fish diversity of the Xingu River prior to the expected large-scale environmental degradation resulting from the forthcoming operation of the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant.},

abstract = {Phosphorus is widely considered to constrain primary productivity in tropical rain forests, yet the chemistry of soil organic phosphorus in such ecosystems remains poorly understood. We assessed the composition of soil organic phosphorus in 19 contrasting soils under lowland tropical forest in the Republic of Panama using NaOH–EDTA extraction and solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The soils spanned a strong rainfall gradient (1730–3404 mm y−1) and contained a wide range of chemical properties (pH 3.3–7.0; total carbon 2.8–10.4{\%}; total phosphorus 74–1650 mg P kg−1). Soil organic phosphorus concentrations ranged between 22 and 494 mg P kg−1 and were correlated positively with total soil phosphorus, pH, and total carbon, but not with annual rainfall. Organic phosphorus constituted 26 ± 1{\%} (mean ± STD error, n = 19) of the total phosphorus, suggesting that this represents a broad emergent property of tropical forest soils. Organic phosphorus occurred mainly as phosphate monoesters (68–96{\%} of total organic phosphorus) with smaller concentrations of phosphate diesters in the form of DNA (4–32{\%} of total organic phosphorus). Phosphonates, which contain a direct carbon–phosphorus bond, were detected in only two soils (3{\%} of the organic phosphorus), while pyrophosphate, an inorganic polyphosphate with a chain length of two, was detected in all soils at concentrations up to 13 mg P kg−1 (3–13{\%} of extracted inorganic phosphorus). Phosphate monoesters were a greater proportion of the total organic phosphorus in neutral soils with high concentrations of phosphorus and organic matter, whereas the proportion of phosphate diesters was greater in very acidic soils low in phosphorus and organic matter. Most soils did not contain detectable concentrations of either myo- or scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate, which is in marked contrast to many temperate mineral soils that contain abundant inositol phosphates. We conclude that soil properties exert a strong control on the amounts and forms of soil organic phosphorus in tropical rain forests, but that the proportion of the total phosphorus in organic forms is relatively insensitive to variation in climate and soil properties. Further work is now required to assess the contribution of soil organic phosphorus to the nutrition and diversity of plants in these species-rich ecosystems.},

Existing SDMs are mainly data-driven and often developed with statistical and machine learning methods but with little consideration of hypothetic ecological knowledge. Conceptual SDMs exist, but lack in performance, making them less interesting for decision management. Therefore, there is a need for model identification tools that search for alternative model formulations. This paper presents a methodology, illustrated with the example of river pollution in Ecuador, using a simple ge-netic algorithm (SGA) to identify well performing SDMs by means of an input variable selection (IVS). An analysis for 14 macroinvertebrate taxa shows that the SGA is able to identify well performing SDMs. It is observed that uncertainty on the model structure is relatively large. The developed tool can aid model developers and decision makers to obtain insights in driving factors shaping the species assemblage.},

abstract = {In tropical mountains, trees are the dominant life form from sea level to above 4,000-m altitude under highly variable thermal conditions (range of mean annual temperatures: {\textless} 8 to {\textgreater} 28A degrees C). How light-saturated net photosynthesis of tropical trees adapts to variation in temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and further environmental factors, that change along elevation gradients, is not precisely known. With gas exchange measurements in mature trees, we determined light-saturated net photosynthesis at ambient temperature (T) and [CO2] (A (sat)) of 40 tree species from 21 families in tropical mountain forests at 1000-, 2000-, and 3000-m elevation in southern Ecuador. We tested the hypothesis that stand-level averages of A (sat) and leaf dark respiration (R (D)) per leaf area remain constant with elevation. Stand-level means of A (sat) were 8.8, 11.3, and 7.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1); those of R (D) 0.8, 0.6, and 0.7 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at 1000-, 2000-, and 3000-m elevation, respectively, with no significant altitudinal trend. We obtained coefficients of among-species variation in A (sat) and R (D) of 20-53{\%} (n = 10-16 tree species per stand). Examining our data in the context of a pan-tropical A (sat) data base for mature tropical trees (c. 170 species from 18 sites at variable elevation) revealed that area-based A (sat) decreases in tropical mountains by, on average, 1.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) per km altitude increase (or by 0.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) per K temperature decrease). The A (sat) decrease occurred despite an increase in leaf mass per area with altitude. Local geological and soil fertility conditions and related foliar N and P concentrations considerably influenced the altitudinal A (sat) patterns. We conclude that elevation is an important influencing factor of the photosynthetic activity of tropical trees. Lowered A (sat) together with a reduced stand leaf area decrease canopy C gain with elevation in tropical mountains.},

Dispersal-related movement can be confounded by factors that vary across landscapes and climates, as well as within and among species, and it has therefore remained difficult to parametrise in SDMs. Here we compared 20 models that have previously been used (or have the potential to be used) to represent dispersal processes in SDM to predict future range shifts in response to climate change. We assessed the different dispersal models in terms of their accuracy at predicting future distributions, as well as the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Atlas d...},

abstract = {Uncertainty in biomass estimates is one of the greatest limitations to models of carbon flux in tropical forests. Previous comparisons of field-based estimates of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of trees greater than 10 cm diameter within Amazonia have been limited by the paucity of data for western Amazon forests, and the use of site-specific methods to estimate biomass from inventory data. In addition, the role of regional variation in stand-level wood specific gravity has not previously been considered. Using data from 56 mature forest plots across Amazonia, we consider the relative roles of species composition (wood specific gravity) and forest structure (basal area) in determining variation in AGB. Mean stand-level wood specific gravity, on a per stem basis, is 15.8{\%} higher in forests in central and eastern, compared with northwestern Amazonia. This pattern is due to the higher diversity and abundance of taxa with high specific gravity values in central and eastern Amazonia, and the greater diversity and abundance of taxa with low specific gravity values in western Amazonia. For two estimates of AGB derived using different allometric equations, basal area explains 51.7{\%} and 63.4{\%}, and stand-level specific gravity 45.4{\%} and 29.7{\%}, of the total variation in AGB. The variation in specific gravity is important because it determines the regional scale, spatial pattern of AGB. When weighting by specific gravity is included, central and eastern Amazon forests have significantly higher AGB than stands in northwest or southwest Amazonia. The regional-scale pattern of species composition therefore defines a broad gradient of AGB across Amazonia.},

abstract = {Estimating diversity and abundance of fish species is fundamental for understanding community structure and dynamics of coral reefs. When designing a sampling protocol, one crucial step is the choice of the most suitable sampling technique which is a compromise between the questions addressed, the available means and the precision required. The objective of this study is to compare the ability to sample reef fish communities at the same locations using two techniques based on the same stationary point count method: one using Underwater Visual Census (UVC) and the other rotating video (STAVIRO). UVC and STAVIRO observations were carried out on the exact same 26 points on the reef slope of an intermediate reef and the associated inner barrier reefs. STAVIRO systems were always deployed 30 min to 1 hour after UVC and set exactly at the same place. Our study shows that; (i) fish community observations by UVC and STAVIRO differed significantly; (ii) species richness and density of large species were not significantly different between techniques; (iii) species richness and density of small species were higher for UVC; (iv) density of fished species was higher for STAVIRO and (v) only UVC detected significant differences in fish assemblage structure across reef type at the spatial scale studied. We recommend that the two techniques should be used in a complementary way to survey a large area within a short period of time. UVC may census reef fish within complex habitats or in very shallow areas such as reef flat whereas STAVIRO would enable carrying out a large number of stations focused on large and diver-averse species, particularly in the areas not covered by UVC due to time and depth constraints. This methodology would considerably increase the spatial coverage and replication level of fish monitoring surveys.},

abstract = {We develop spatial statistical models for stream networks that can estimate relationships between a response variable and other covariates, make predictions at unsampled locations, and predict an average or total for a stream or a stream segment. There have been very few attempts to develop valid spatial covariance models that incorporate flow, stream distance, or both. The application of typical spatial autocovariance functions based on Euclidean distance, such as the spherical covariance model, are not valid when using stream distance. In this paper we develop a large class of valid models that incorporate flow and stream distance by using spatial moving averages. These methods integrate a moving average function, or kernel, against a white noise process. By running the moving average function upstream from a location, we develop models that use flow, and by construction they are valid models based on stream distance. We show that with proper weighting, many of the usual spatial models based on Euclidean distance have a counterpart for stream networks. Using sulfate concentrations from an example data set, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS), we show that models using flow may be more appropriate than models that only use stream distance. For the MBSS data set, we use restricted maximum likelihood to fit a valid covariance matrix that uses flow and stream distance, and then we use this covariance matrix to estimate fixed effects and make kriging and block kriging predictions.},

abstract = {This paper discusses comparative advantages of the Slash and Burn System (SBS) practiced by the small farmers in the humid tropics of Central Africa with regard to agricultural mod ernization. The purpose of the paper is to (i) serve to further the dialogue between various stakeholders (communities, practitioners, scientists, policy makers, donors, etc.) in the quest to improve small farmer livelihood and, (ii) confront conflicting attitudes among stakeholders between Slash and Burn practices, sustainable agricultural development and environmental protection. Over centuries, small farmers in humid dense tropical forests of Central Africa, as well as in other parts of Africa, have developed tree-based farming systems based on shifting cultivation and slash-andburn, to cope with low soil fertility and food production decline. The practices consisted to clear forest lands and to grow subsistence crops (rainfed rice, plantain, cassava, maize, etc.) on the fresh ashes from the burned biomass, and putting the exhausted land on fallow for 10 to 15 years after 2 -3 years of production Under normal circumstances, the system is ecologically sustainable with high potential to restore soil fertility and to allow forest recovery. However, by mid-seventies, with the climate degradation and the population fast growth and increasing needs for forest products and fertile agricultural lands, the system started breaking down leading to important environmental degradation. Although they are aware of its negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity, the small farmers living in the Congo Basin forests and savannah continue perpetuating this system, favouring it as the most profitable system with regard to their capacities and low investment conditions. On-going debate is far to reunite stakeholders over the impacts of such practices on environmental degradation and sustainable forestry development. However, whatever is the vision or perception one may have, the fact is land and forest resources, with along biodiversity are at continuous threat. Cost-effective solutions are of great and urgent need to ensure environment sustainability and profitability while securing improved livelihood and reducing poverty. An expanded holistic approach of tree-based farming system that fosters livelihoods and is less risky economically, socially and environmentally should be defined beyond the restrictive concept of agroforestry centred on forest products and environmental benefits},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) tends to limit plant productivity on young soils; phosphorus (P) becomes increasingly limiting in ancient soils because it gradually disappears through leaching and erosion. Plant traits that are regarded as adaptations to N- and P-limited conditions include mycorrhizas and cluster roots. Mycorrhizas 'scavenge' P from solution or 'mine' insoluble organic N. Cluster roots function in severely P-impoverished landscapes, 'mining' P fixed as insoluble inorganic phosphates. The 'scavenging' and 'mining' strategies of mycorrhizal species without and non-mycorrhizal species with cluster roots, respectively, allow functioning on soils that differ markedly in P availability. Based on recent advances in our understanding of these contrasting strategies of nutrient acquisition, we provide an explanation for the distribution of mycorrhizal species on less P-impoverished soils, and for why, globally, cluster-bearing species dominate on severely P-impoverished, ancient soils, where P sensitivity is relatively common. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: The slopes of the eastern Andes harbour some of the highest biodiversity on Earth and a high proportion of endemic species. However, there have been only a few and limited descriptions of carbon budgets in tropical montane forest regions. Aims: We present the first comprehensive data on the production, allocation and cycling of carbon for two high elevation (ca. 3000 m) tropical montane cloud forest plots in the Kos{\~{n}}ipata Valley, Peruvian Andes. Methods: We measured the main components and seasonal variation of net primary productivity (NPP), autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) respiration to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) in two 1-ha plots. Results: NPP for the two plots was estimated to be 7.05 ± 0.39 and 8.04 ± 0.47 Mg C ha?1 year?1, GPP to be 22.33 ± 2.23 and 26.82 ± 2.97 Mg C ha?1 year?1 and CUE was 0.32 ± 0.04 and 0.30 ± 0.04. Conclusions: We found strong seasonality in NPP and moderate seasonality of Ra, suggesting that forest NPP is driven by changes in photosynthesis and highlighting the importance of variation in solar radiation. Our findings imply that trees invest more in biomass production in the cooler season with lower solar radiation and more in maintenance during the warmer and high solar radiation period.},

(2) Arithmetic mean concentrations in leaf and composite stem samples in Mor Ridge forest were, respectively (in mg g-D), N, 11.1, 2.0; P, 0 64, 0.15; K, 4.3, 1.6; Ca, 8.0, 1.9; Mg, 3.3, 0.80. The corresponding concentrations for well-developed Mull Ridge forest were N, 17 8, 3.1; P, 0.76, 0 13; K, 11.7, 3.1; Ca, 10.0, 3.0; Mg, 4.6, 0.61. Concentrations calculated by dividing the total weight of an element by the biomass dry weight were lower than arithmetic means in every case. (3) Concentrations per unit area (kg ha-') and (in parentheses) per unit dry weight (mg g-1) of above-ground standing crop were lower in the lower stature, slower growing Mor Ridge forest: N, 426 (2.0); P, 29.7 (0.14); K, 272 (1.3); Ca, 353 (1.7); Mg, 155 (0.74) than in the well-developed Mull Ridge forest: N, 857 (2-5); P, 41.2 (0-12); K, 829 (2.5); Ca, 940 (2.8); Mg, 193 (0-57). (4) First estimates of the amounts of nutrients used in trunk growth in the Mor Ridge forest each year are 1.9{\%} of extractable soil N (NO3 + NH4), 0.4{\%} of exchangeable soil K, 2.3{\%} of exchangeable soil Ca and 0.08{\%} of exchangeable soil Mg. For well-developed Mull Ridge forest the corresponding values are N, 2.0{\%}; K, 1.2{\%}; Ca, 1. 1{\%}; Mg, 0.3{\%}. (5) The impoverishment of the Mor Ridge forest compared to the well-developed Mull Ridge forest is probably due to the limitation of growth by the supply of N and K, and possibly by P and Ca. (6) The impoverishment of the Jamaican Upper Montane Rain forest compared to better-developed Montane Rain forests at higher altitudes on larger mountains is probably not a result of poor supply of N, K, Ca or Mg, though the role of P is still not clear. (7) Tropical montane rain forests in general may be short of N, P, K and Ca compared to the most nutrient-rich tropical lowland rain forests.},

abstract = {The widespread occurrence of mycorrhizae in nature and their importance in the mineral nutrition of almost all plants has been extensively documented but despite this mycorrhizae have not been included in nutrient cycling studies of forest ecosystems. This neglect may be due to a failure on the part of researchers to recognize the functional differences between mycorrhizae and roots and to the labour-intensive effort needed to study mycorrhizae. Biomass or surface area of mycorrhizae must be measured before information on ion absorption by mycorrhizae can be applied to forest ecosystems. A full assessment of the importance of mycorrhizae in nutrient cycling also requires data on mycorrhiza production, senescence, and decomposition. Few mycorrhiza studies have provided such data. Consequently, our information on nutrient cycling is derived from fine root (less or equal to 5 mm in diameter) data which may or may not include mycorrhizae. Recent studies have shown that most of the organic input to the decomposition process results from fine root production. Fine root mortality and decomposition is also more important than other mechanisms for returning nitrogen immobilized in vegetation to the soil in both deciduous and coniferous forests. A recently completed study indicates that mycorrhizae account for 50{\%} of the annual throughput of biomass and for 43{\%} of the nitrogen released annually in a Douglas fir ecosystem. These transfers are five times larger than the releases from litterfall or litter decomposition. Clearly, the study of mycorrhizal nutrient cycling is in an embryonic state and considerable additional research is needed.},

abstract = {Species distribution modelling has gained importance since the introduction of the Water Framework Directive. Several efforts have been made for the development of decision support tools to aid river basin managers. However, there is a mismatch between the available ecological models and stakeholder needs. For example, models can be so complex that they can only be applied on a limited set of species, or models can be so qualitative that they fail to deliver insight in the underlying processes behind changing ecological quality. Yet, much is known already about ecology and ecography, in general and for specific species. To valorize this available knowledge, we have developed species distribution models for macroinvertebrates in Flanders grounded in ecological theories. We introduce a conceptual approach based on niche and landscape filter theories. To apply the concept on many different macroinvertebrate species, the model development uses both data from Flanders, expert knowledge and data from other similar river systems. Implementing these niche and migration models results in a moderate predictive accuracy (average Kappa of 0.19). For sensitive species that are essential for an ecological quality status the approach results in a higher accuracy. Despite the moderate predictive accuracy, the resulting models have a good applicability. The models concur well with ecological knowledge on species preferences. Furthermore, throughout the model development process stakeholders and end users have been involved to discuss model structure and its related assumptions. This ensures that the developed model is credible and acceptable. This model approach has shown to be a way forward for ecological decision support in river management in Flanders, but inclusion of additional knowledge on migration behaviour and species interactions could help to improve the predictive accuracy the models in the future.},

Combinations of these three images were merged to evaluate the relative importance of multi-temporal and multi-spatial imagery to classification accuracy. The objectbased classification using all three-image datasets produced the highest overall accuracy (82.0{\%}), while the object-based classification using the high-spatial resolution image merged with the SPOT-5 leaf-off image had the second highest overall accuracy (78.2{\%}). While not significantly different from each other, these two object-based classifications were statistically significantly different from the other classifications.

We examined the contributions of habitat association, local soil environment, and elemental interactions to variation in foliar elemental concentrations in tropical trees using methods that account for phylogeny. We sampled top-soils and leaves of 58 tropical trees in heath forest (HF) on nutrient-poor sand and mixed dipterocarp forest (MDF) on nutrient-rich clay soils. A phylogenetic generalized least squares method was used to determine how foliar nutrient and aluminium (Al) concentrations varied in response to habitat distribution, soil chemistry and other elemental concentrations. Foliar nitrogen (N) and Al concentrations were greater for specialists of MDF than for specialists of HF, while foliar calcium (Ca) concentrations showed the opposite trend. Foliar magnesium (Mg) concentrations were lower for generalists than for MDF specialists. Foliar element concentrations were correlated with fine-scale variation in soil chemistry in phylogenetically controlled analyses across species, but there was limited within-species plasticity in foliar elemental concentrations. Among Al accumulators, foliar Al concentration was positively associated with foliar Ca and Mg concentrations, and negatively associated with foliar phosphorus (P) concentrations. The Al-accumulation trait and relationships between foliar elemental and Al concentrations may contribute to species habitat partitioning and ecosystem-level differences in biogeochemical cycles.},

There were two controls of soil isotopic compositions: new litter inputs and overall isotopic fractionation during decomposition. Litter inputs lowered soil $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C values while decomposition increased $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C values. Leaf and root litter inputs averaged -3.8 and -1.6‰ $\delta$15N and -27.3 and -28.2‰ $\delta$13C, respectively. Field experiments showed that low surface soil $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C values resulted when litter inputs were high. Laboratory experiments showed that overall isotopic fractionation during decomposition left residual soil N and C enriched in 15N and 13C, and could explain the high $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C values observed in deeper forest soils (+5.9‰ $\delta$15N and -23.6‰ $\delta$13C for 10 to 20 cm soils). Our results suggest two pools of naturally labeled N in forest soils: surface N with low $\delta$15N values and subsoil N with high $\delta$15N values. Natural abundance measurements of soil N may be useful for following the importance of these two N pools in forest N cycles.

abstract = {1. The cycling of nutrients in litterfall is considered a key mechanism in the maintenance of tropical forest fertility but its importance has rarely been quantified experimentally. 2. We carried out a long-term (5 years), large-scale litter manipulation experiment in lowland semi-evergreen tropical forest to determine how changes in litterfall affect forest nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that: (i) long-term litter removal would decrease the forest's nutrient supply; (ii) litter addition would increase the forest's nutrient supply; (iii) soil and foliar nutrient concentrations would change in response to litter manipulation and would eventually affect above-ground productivity. 3. To test our hypotheses, we measured trunk growth, litterfall, and nutrient concentrations in live leaves, litter and soil in plots where litter was removed once a month (L−), litter was added once a month (L+) and controls (CT). 4. After 5 years, the concentration of nitrate in the soil and soil stocks of inorganic nitrogen were higher in the L+ plots and lower in the L− plots compared to the controls. Ammonium concentrations in the soil were also lower in the L− plots. Nitrogen in leaves and litter and the annual nitrogen return by litter were higher in the L+ plots, while potassium return was lower in the L− plots. Surprisingly, our treatments had little effect on phosphorus in soil, leaves or litter, even though lowland tropical forests are generally thought to be largely phosphorus limited. 5. Trunk growth of large trees was not affected by litter manipulation but rainy season litterfall from 2003 to 2008 was 13{\%} higher in the L+ plots compared to the controls. 6. Synthesis. Litter removal affected forest nutrient cycling and productivity less than expected, probably because the soil at our site is moderately fertile. However, litter addition increased litterfall indicating that some limitation of forest production was removed by litter addition. We expected strong effects of litter manipulation on phosphorus cycling; instead, we found a stronger effect on nitrogen cycling. Our results suggest that litter is an important source of nutrients, in particular nitrogen, to trees in this lowland semi-evergreen tropical forest.},

Lack of consideration of cloud moisture input may constitute a serious error in the determination of the water balance of tropical watersheds incorporating cloud forests. -from Authors},

abstract = {Insights into how terrestrial ecosystems affect the Earth's response to changes in climate and rising atmospheric CO(2) levels rely heavily on the predictions of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). These models contain detailed mechanistic representations of biological processes affecting terrestrial ecosystems; however, their ability to simultaneously predict field-based measurements of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and carbon fluxes has remained largely untested. In this study, we address this issue by developing a constrained implementation of a new structured TBM, the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), which explicitly tracks the dynamics of fine-scale ecosystem structure and function. Carbon and water flux measurements from an eddy-flux tower are used in conjunction with forest inventory measurements of tree growth and mortality at Harvard Forest (42.5 degrees N, 72.1 degrees W) to estimate a number of important but weakly constrained model parameters. Evaluation against a decade of tower flux and forest dynamics measurements shows that the constrained ED2 model yields greatly improved predictions of annual net ecosystem productivity, carbon partitioning, and growth and mortality dynamics of both hardwood and conifer trees. The generality of the model formulation is then evaluated by comparing the model's predictions against measurements from two other eddy-flux towers and forest inventories of the northeastern United States and Quebec. Despite the markedly different composition throughout this region, the optimized model realistically predicts observed patterns of carbon fluxes and tree growth. These results demonstrate how TBMs parameterized with field-based measurements can provide quantitative insight into the underlying biological processes governing ecosystem composition, structure, and function at larger scales.},

abstract = {This paper describes an application of MOHID modelling system to a shallow temperate coastal lagoon in Portugal's western coast (Ria de Aveiro), simulating more than one primary producer, for a better understanding of the existing ecological dynamics and creating a useful tool to delineate land activities management practices. MOHID water quality model is driven by a physical transport model and simulates the dynamics and productivity of the two main primary producers (phytoplankton and macroalgae) as well as the cycling of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen in interaction with sediment and hydrodynamics. The integrated model is forced by exchanges with the Atlantic Ocean (tide), atmosphere, and by sediment and nutrient inputs from the upstream rivers and other discharges. Focus is given to the light parameterization of primary production, influence of hydro and sediment dynamics and to the prediction of seaweed beds distribution. The results obtained show that the model is better adjusted to field data with macroalgae's simulation and that macroalgae can have an important role in primary production. Hydrodynamic conditions can be significant in the competition between the two primary producers, determining the predominant groups as well as their limiting factors. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. Macroclimatic variation along latitudinal gradients provides an excellent natural laboratory to investigate the role of temperature and the potential impacts of climate warming on terrestrial organ- isms. 2. Here, we review the use of latitudinal gradients for ecological climate change research, in com- parison with altitudinal gradients and experimental warming, and illustrate their use and caveats with a meta-analysis of latitudinal intraspecific variation in important life-history traits of vascular plants. 3. We first provide an overview of latitudinal patterns in temperature and other abiotic and biotic environmental variables in terrestrial ecosystems. We then assess the latitudinal intraspecific variation present in five key life-history traits [plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) stoichiometry, seed mass and root:shoot (R:S) ratio] in natural populations or common garden experiments across a total of 98 plant species. 4. Intraspecific leaf N:P ratio and seed mass significantly decreased with latitude in natural popula- tions. Conversely, the plant height decreased and SLA increased significantly with latitude of popula- tion origin in common garden experiments. However, less than a third of the investigated latitudinal transect studies also formally disentangled the effects of temperature from other environmental driv- ers which potentially hampers the translation from latitudinal effects into a temperature signal. 5. Synthesis. Latitudinal gradients provide a methodological set-up to overcome the drawbacks of other observational and experimental warming methods. Our synthesis indicates that many life- history traits of plants vary with latitude but the translation of latitudinal clines into responses to temperature is a crucial step. Therefore, especially adaptive differentiation of populations and con- founding environmental factors other than temperature need to be considered. More generally, inte- grated approaches of observational studies along temperature gradients, experimental methods and common garden experiments increasingly emerge as the way forward to further our understanding of species and community responses to climate warming.},

Methods: We determined leaf mass per area (LMA, g m?2), leaf tissue density (L d, g cm?3), and foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content, both on a mass (N m and P m, {\%}) and area (N a and P a, g m?2) basis for the most abundant species locally.

N m declined significantly with altitude (2.39?1.25 {\%}, P {\textless} 0.05), but N m contents were higher than in comparable studies. The relatively high N m and low LMA values are consistent with published global leaf trait datasets. No altitudinal trend for P m was found; rather, our data highlighted the spatial variability in P m (and P a) within and among sites at different elevations. Foliar N:P ratios did not show a trend with altitude and did not indicate N limitation except at 3000 m altitude.

abstract = {Foliar respiration is a major component of ecosystem respiration, yet extrapolations are often uncertain in tropical forests because of indirect estimates of leaf area index (LAI). A portable tower was used to directly measure LAI and night-time foliar respiration from 52 vertical transects throughout an old-growth tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. In this study, we (1) explored the effects of structural, functional and environmental variables on foliar respiration; (2) extrapolated foliar respiration to the ecosystem; and (3) estimated ecosystem respiration. Foliar respiration temperature response was constant within plant functional group, and foliar morphology drove much of the within-canopy variability in respiration and foliar nutrients. Foliar respiration per unit ground area was 3.5 +/- 0.2 micromol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and ecosystem respiration was 9.4 +/- 0.5 micromol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)[soil = 41{\%}; foliage = 37{\%}; woody = 14{\%}; coarse woody debris (CWD) = 7{\%}]. When modelled with El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) year temperatures, foliar respiration was 9{\%} greater than when modelled with temperatures from a normal year, which is in the range of carbon sink versus source behaviour for this forest. Our ecosystem respiration estimate from component fluxes was 33{\%} greater than night-time net ecosystem exchange for the same forest, suggesting that studies reporting a large carbon sink for tropical rain forests based solely on eddy flux measurements may be in error.},

abstract = {Habitat models serve three main purposes: First, to predict species occurrences on the basis of abiotic and biotic variables, second to improve the understanding of species-habitat relationships and third, to quantify habitat requirements. The use of statistical models to predict the likely occurrence or distribution of species based on relevant variables is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and wildlife management. This article aims to provide an overview of the current status of development and application of statistical methodologies for analysing the species-environment association, with a clear emphasis on aquatic habitat. It describes the main types of univariate and multivariate techniques available for analysis of species-environment association, and specifically focuses on the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the available statistical methods to estimate habitat suitability. A second objective of this article is to propose new approaches using existing statistical methods. A wide array of habitat statistical models has been developed to analyse habitat-species relationship. Generally, physical habitat is dependent on more than one variable (e.g. depth, velocity, substrate, cover) and several suitability indices must be combined to define a composite index. Multivariate approaches are more appropriate for the analysis of aquatic habitat as they inherently consider the interrelation and correlation structure of the environmental variables. Ordinary multiple linear regression and logistic regression are popular methods often used for modelling of species and their relationships with environment. Ridge regression and Principal component regression are particularly useful when the independent variables are highly correlated. More recent regression modelling paradigms like generalized linear models (GLMs) present advantages in dealing with non-normal environmental variables. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and artificial neural networks are better suited for analysis of non-linear relationships between species distribution and environmental variables. The fuzzy logic approach presents advantages in dealing with uncertainties that often exist in habitat modelling. Appropriate methods for analysis of multi-species data are also presented. Finally, the few existing comparative studies for predictive modelling are reviewed, and advantages and disadvantages of different methods are discussed.},

FAO's AquaCrop model, which simulates yield response to water, has been calibrated to explore alternative water management strategies in teff crop. To calibrate and evaluate this model, we used independent data sets of the cropping season 2008 and 2009 in the northern Ethiopia. The teff crop cover, biomass and soil water simulated by the model agreed well with the observed data. The model revealed that the grain-water use efficiency of teff increased when supplementary irrigation after start of flowering was increased from 0 to 95 mm. The biomass-water use efficiency showed the opposite trend: it decreased. The implication of these results is that if land is not a constraint, and if the intention is to grow teff for its biomass, the best option is to use the available water to grow teff with deficit irrigation. But when the major intention is to produce grain, the best option is an optimum irrigation application. It is concluded that the AquaCrop model can be used to explore management options to improve teff water productivity in the area. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Leaf water repellency was examined in three distinct ecosystems to test the hypothesis that tropical montane cloud forest species have a higher degree of leaf water repellency than species from tropical dry forests and species from temperate foothills-grassland vegetation. Leaf water repellency was measured by calculating the contact angle of the leaf surface and the line tangent to a water droplet through the point of contact on the adaxial and the abaxial surface. Leaf water repellency was significantly different between the three study areas. The hypothesis that leaf water repellency is higher in cloud forest species than tropical dry forests and temperate foothills-grassland vegetation was not confirmed in this study. Leaf water repellency was lower for cloud forest species (adaxial surface = 50.8°; abaxial surface = 82.9°) than tropical dry forest species (adaxial surface = 74.5°; abaxial surface = 87.3°) and temperate foothills-grassland species (adaxial surface = 77.6°; abaxial surface = 95.8°).

Sustainable development requires the ability to predict responses of species to anthropogenic pressures. We investigated the large scale, long term effect of important human alterations of benthic habitats with an integrated approach combining engineering and ecological modelling. We focused our analysis on the Oosterschelde basin (The Netherlands), which was partially embanked by a storm surge barrier (Oosterscheldekering, 1986). We made use of 1) a prognostic (numerical) environmental (hydrodynamic) model and 2) a novel application of quantile regression to Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) to simulate both the realized and potential (habitat suitability) abundance of four macrozoobenthic species: Scoloplos armiger, Peringia ulvae, Cerastoderma edule and Lanice conchilega. The analysis shows that part of the fluctuations in macrozoobenthic biomass stocks during the last decades is related to the effect of the coastal defense infrastructures on the basin morphology and hydrodynamics. The methodological framework we propose is particularly suitable for the analysis of large abundance datasets combined with high-resolution environmental data. Our analysis provides useful information on future changes in ecosystem functionality induced by human activities.},

abstract = {The spruce-fir [Picea rubens Sarg.-Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir.] forests of the southern Appalachian Mountains are considered refugial, endangered communities that exist on only seven mountaintop areas in Virginia and North Carolina, USA. These relict forests continue to be threatened by stress factors such as logging, acid rain deposition, attacks from invasive insects, and climate change. It has been suggested that these communities have persisted because of frequent cloudiness and periods of cloud immersion (fog), although few studies have examined corresponding effects on microclimate and tree ecophysiology. Incident sunlight (PPFD), air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and xylem water potentials were measured throughout the summer growing season in Mount Mitchell State Park, NC (35°45'53'N, 82°15'54'W), along with continuous camera recordings of the forest canopy and accompanying cloud conditions. Approximately 60{\%} of all summer days had at least 2h of cloud immersion with the large majority (80.3{\%}) of immersion events occurring during morning hours. Cloud-immersed days had the greatest reduction in cumulative daily PPFD compared to clear days (11.09molm

Moreover, xylem water potential ($\Psi$) increased significantly (∼0.2MPa; values) from morning to afternoon on cloud-immersed days. In contrast, clear days showed no afternoon recovery in $\Psi$, but a continued decrease during the afternoon. Juvenile $\Psi$ was more responsive to daily cloud regime compared to adult $\Psi$ and had a strong negative correlation with vapor pressure deficit. When all measurement days were sorted by the cloud pattern of the previous day, there was a strong response in juveniles trees, i.e. $\Psi$ increased following previous afternoon cloud-immersion. Juveniles of both species also had greater seasonal decreases in $\Psi$ than adults (P. rubens, adult: 0.05MPa, juvenile: 0.13MPa; A. fraseri, adult: 0.06MPa, juvenile: 0.20Mpa). For climate change models that predict a higher cloud base (resulting in less immersion) and dryer conditions, the water relations of Abies fraseri and Picea rubens could be substantially and negatively influenced. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach which was developed to find an optimal combination of candidate metrics for creating a fish-based estuarine biotic index (EBI) for defining the quality status of an estuarine area. The key idea was that a powerful index should minimise two prediction errors simultaneously: falsely declaring the status of a site as disturbed while it is not (Type I error) and the reverse, falsely declaring a disturbed site as undisturbed (Type II error). The balance between both errors is an inherent characteristic of an index and can be displayed as a curve. The area under this curve (AUC) is a measure of the misclassification rate (smaller = better). This criterion was the basis for a stepwise approach whereby in each step a metric resulting in the highest reduction of AUC was added. Five metrics were selected and the distribution of their average was the basis to derive the thresholds for the classes of the EBI. This paper presents the fish-based index (EBI) for the brackish Schelde estuary in Flanders (Belgium). The index was calibrated against fyke net data from five sites during the period from 1995 to 2004. The sites ranged in quality from moderately impacted to very disturbed, classes 3 to 5 respectively. Despite there being neither of the highest classes 1 (high) and 2 (good), the EBI presented can serve as an evaluation tool in the highly impacted situation in Flanders as it discriminates well between moderate and highly impacted sites. In addition, its definition complies with the biological status classes of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).},

abstract = {Effects of elevated N deposition on forest aboveground biomass were evaluated using long-term data from N addition experiments and from forest observation plots in Switzerland. N addition experiments with saplings were established both on calcareous and on acidic soils, in 3 plots with Fagus sylvatica and in 4 plots with Picea abies. The treatments were conducted during 15 years and consisted of additions of dry NH4NO3 at rates of 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160??kg??N??ha-1??yr-1. The same tree species were observed in permanent forest observation plots covering the time span between 1984 and 2007, at modeled N deposition rates of 12-46??kg??N??ha-1??yr-1. Experimental N addition resulted in either no change or in a decreased shoot growth and in a reduced phosphorus concentration in the foliage in all experimental plots. In the forest, a decrease of foliar P concentration was observed between 1984 and 2007, resulting in insufficient concentrations in 71{\%} and 67{\%} of the Fagus and Picea plots, respectively, and in an increasing N:P ratio in Fagus. Stem increment decreased during the observation period even if corrected for age. Forest observations suggest an increasing P limitation in Swiss forests especially in Fagus which is accompanied by a growth decrease whereas the N addition experiments support the hypothesis that elevated N deposition is an important cause for this development. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The upstream migration of adult anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) has been dramatically altered and fish may be experiencing energetically costly delays at dams. To explore this notion, we estimated the energetic costs of migration and reproduction of Yakima River-bound spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha using a sequential analysis of their proximate composition (i.e., percent water, fat, protein, and ash). Tissues (muscle, viscera, and gonad) were sampled from fish near the start of their migration (Bonneville Dam), at a mid point (Roza Dam, 510km upstream from Bonneville Dam) and from fresh carcasses on the spawning grounds (about 100km above Roza Dam). At Bonneville Dam, the energy reserves of these fish were remarkably high, primarily due to the high percentage of fat in the muscle (18–20{\%}; energy content over 11 kJ g?1). The median travel time for fish from Bonneville to Roza Dam was 27 d and ranged from 18 to 42 d. Fish lost from 6 to 17{\%} of their energy density in muscle, depending on travel time. On average, fish taking a relatively long time for migration between dams used from 5 to 8{\%}more energy from the muscle than faster fish. From the time they passed Bonneville Damto death, these fish, depending on gender, used 95–99{\%} of their muscle and 73–86{\%} of their visceral lipid stores. Also, both sexes used about 32{\%} of their muscular and very little of their visceral protein stores. However, we were unable to relate energy use and reproductive success to migration history. Our results suggest a possible influence of the CRB hydroelectric system on adult salmonid energetics},

abstract = {Hooghly-Matla estuarine ecosystem is one of the largest estuarine ecosystems of the world. Sagar island is the largest delta in this estuarine complex. This island is criss-crossed by small and large creeks with mangrove vegetation and all are connected to the principal estuarine water. Decomposition of mangrove litter in soil is major source of inorganic nutrient to phytoplankton of the adjacent creeks. Deforestation of mangrove affects the primary production, which in turn reduces the availability of dissolved oxygen for the organisms residing in the estuary. Considering the importance of dissolved oxygen in various aspects of aquatic life, a dynamic model of dissolved oxygen at Sagar island of Hooghly-Matla estuarine complex with the help of single dimension differential equation is proposed in the present paper. Different physical, chemical and biological factors such as solar irradiance, temperature, salinity of water, particulate organic matter, re-aeration, wind velocity, phytoplankton and zooplankton, which control the fluctuation of dissolved oxygen, are included in the present model. Most of the parameter values are collected directly from the field surveys. The parameter values which are not able to collect from the field, obtained from literatures are calibrated. To make the model realistic it is properly validated with observed data and to know the statistical significance, chi square goodness fit test is performed. Field surveys are performed over two years. During calibration and validation, two sets of data (first year and second year data) are used. Chi-square values are 5.97 and 6.17 for first and second sets of data respectively (p{\textless}. 0.05). Sensitivity analysis reveals that optimal light intensity is the most sensitive parameter for dissolved oxygen dynamics. Results also show that wind velocity, solar irradiation, salinity of water and temperature are important factors for controlling the dynamics of dissolved oxygen. Macrophytes have very little contribution to oxygen production in the creeks of Sagar island. Model reveals that low dissolved oxygen in the creek water is one of the causes of decline in fish population of the estuary. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In municipal solid waste management system, decision makers have to develop an insight into the processes namely, waste generation, collection, transportation, processing, and disposal methods. Many parameters (e.g., waste generation rate, functioning costs of facilities, transportation cost, and revenues) in this system are associated with uncertainties. Often, these uncertainties of parameters need to be modeled under a situation of data scarcity for generating probability distribution function or membership function for stochastic mathematical programming or fuzzy mathematical programming respectively, with only information of extreme variations. Moreover, if uncertainties are ignored, then the problems like insufficient capacities of waste management facilities or improper utilization of available funds may be raised. To tackle uncertainties of these parameters in a more efficient manner an algorithm, based on interval analysis, has been developed. This algorithm is applied to find optimal solutions for a facility location model, which is formulated to select economically best locations of transfer stations in a hypothetical urban center. Transfer stations are an integral part of contemporary municipal solid waste management systems, and economic siting of transfer stations ensures financial sustainability of this system. The model is written in a mathematical programming language AMPL with KNITRO as a solver. The developed model selects five economically best locations out of ten potential locations with an optimum overall cost of [394,836, 757,440] Rs.1Rs. is Indian currency and 1 Rs. = 0.015 USD as of 18th October 2016. /day ([5906, 11,331] USD/day) approximately.

abstract = {Bacteria and fungi drive the cycling of plant litter in forests, but little is known about their role in tropical rain forest nutrient cycling, despite the high rates of litter decay observed in these ecosystems. However, litter decay rates are not uniform across tropical rain forests. For example, decomposition can differ dramatically over small spatial scales between low-diversity, monodominant rain forests, and species-rich, mixed forests. Because the climatic patterns and soil parent material are identical in co-occurring mixed and monodominant forests, differences in forest floor accumulation, litter production, and decomposition between these forests may be biotically mediated. To test this hypothesis, we conducted field and laboratory studies in a monodominant rain forest in which the ectomycorrhizal tree Dicymbe corymbosa forms {\textgreater}80{\%} of the canopy, and a diverse, mixed forest dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. After 2 years, decomposition was significantly slower in the monodominant forest (P {\textless} 0.001), but litter production was significantly greater in the mixed forest (P {\textless} 0.001). In the laboratory, we found microbial community biomass was greater in the mixed forest (P = 0.02), and the composition of fungal communities was distinct between the two rain forest types (P = 0.001). Sequencing of fungal rDNA revealed a significantly lower richness of saprotrophic fungi in the monodominant forest (19 species) relative to the species-rich forest (84 species); moreover, only 4{\%} percent of fungal sequences occurred in both forests. These results show that nutrient cycling patterns in tropical forests can vary dramatically over small spatial scales, and that changes in microbial community structure likely drive the observed differences in decomposition.},

Models and observations alone provide imperfect representations of the ocean state, but together they can offer improved estimates. Variational and sequential methods are among the most widely used in regional ocean systems, and there have been exciting recent advances in ensemble and four-dimensional variational approaches.

abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques have only recently been applied in the marine environment to detect the presence of marine species. Species-specific primers and probes were designed to detect the eDNA of the endangered Maugean skate (Zearaja maugeana) from as little as 1 L of water collected at depth (10±15 m) in Macquarie Harbour (MH), Tasmania. The identity of the eDNA was confirmed as Z. maugeana by sequencing the qPCR products and aligning these with the target sequence for a 100{\%} match. This result has validated the use of this eDNA technique for detecting a rare species, Z. maugeana, in the wild. Being able to investigate the presence, and possibly the abundance, of Z. maugeana in MH and Bathurst harbour (BH), would be addressing a conservation imperative for the endangered Z. maugeana. For future application of this technique in the field, the rate of decay was determined for Z. maugeana eDNA under ambient dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (55{\%} saturation) and lower DO (20{\%} saturation) levels, revealing that the eDNA can be detected for 4 and 16 hours respectively, after which eDNA concentration drops below the detection threshold of the assay. With the rate of decay being influenced by starting eDNA concentrations, it is recommended that samples be filtered as soon as possible after collection to minimize further loss of eDNA prior to and during sample processing.},

abstract = {The extensive existing data set on the oceanography of Torres Strait (separating Australia and Papua New Guinea) is reviewed and is used to show that the long-term east to west water flux through Torres Strait is about 0.04. Sv. To explain this finding, a high resolution, finite element, depth-integrated (2D) model of Torres Strait is set-up. The model is driven by the wind and the open boundary conditions that are prescribed in the Coral Sea, the northern Great Barrier Reef continental shelf, the Gulf of Papua, and the Gulf of Carpentaria. The latter/open boundary conditions were taken from field data. The model suggests that the wind alone over Torres Strait generates negligible net currents; the net currents are instead generated by the wind setting up a water slope across Torres Strait through its opposing influence on the mean sea levels in the Gulf of Carpentaria and in the Coral Sea. The model predicts that the long-term, net east-west flow through Torres Strait is small to negligible, in agreement with field data. The model also reveals that large scale flow dynamics are largely restricted to reef passages and open waters, and that areas of shallow waters and areas densely populated with reefs and islands are poorly flushed. Finally, the model also reveals the prevalence of highly energetic tidal flows around shoals, reefs, islands and reef passages, and these swift tidal currents are responsible for the small net flow through Torres Strait through the sticky water effect. These findings enable us to propose a general water circulation model for the whole Great Barrier Reef during southeast winds. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mycorrhizae establish symbiotic relationships with plants and play an essential role in plant growth, disease protection, and overall soil quality. Of the seven types of mycorrhizae described in current scientific literature (arbuscular, ecto, ectendo, arbutoid, monotropoid, ericoid and orchidaceous mycorrhizae), the arbuscular and ectomycorrhizae are the most abundant and widespread. This chapter presents an overview of current knowledge of mycorrhizal inter- actions, processes, and potential benefits to society. The molecular basis of nutrient exchange between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and host plants is presented; the role of AM fungi in disease protection, alleviation of heavy metal stress and increasing grain production is also reviewed. Use of mycorrhizae, primarily AM and ectomycorrhizae (ECM), on plant growth promotion and disease suppression are discussed and their implications on sus- tainable agriculture are considered. The effect of co-inoculation of AM fungi and beneficial saprophytic mycoflora, in terms of plant growth promotion and root colonization, are discussed. The role of AM fungi in the restoration of native ecosystems and the mycorrhizosphere effect of multitrophic interactions are briefly outlined. The mechanisms by which mycorrhizae transform a dis- turbed ecosystem into productive land are briefly discussed. The importance of reintroduction of mycorrhizal systems in the rhizosphere is emphasiszed and their impact in landscape regeneration and in bioremediation of contaminated soils are discussed. The importance of ECM in forest ecosystems, and asso- ciations of ECM in tropical rainforests and their function in maintaining tropical monodominance are discussed. In Vitro mycorrhization of micropropagated plants and visualizing and quantifying endorhizal fungi are briefly explained.},

abstract = {Aim Remote sensing data have been used in a growing number of studies to directly predict species richness or to improve the performance of species distribution models (SDMs), but their suitability for stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) remains unclear. In this case study, we evaluated the potential and limitations of remotely sensed data in S-SDMs and addressed the commonly observed overestimation of species richness by S-SDMs. Location Mexico. Methods Phenological and statistical metrics were derived from remotely sensed time series data (2001–2009) of the Terra-MODIS enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature products. In a series of climatic and remote sensing-based SDMs, the distribution ranges of 40 species of the genus Pinus (Pinaceae) were modelled based on presence-only herbarium and field data using the maximum entropy algorithm and summed to estimate species richness. Three different species-specific thresholds were applied to convert continuous model predictions into binary maps. Modelled species richness was compared to independent data from the Mexican National Forest Inventory. Results The inclusion of remote sensing data led to significantly better predictions of species richness in comparison to the climate-based models for the summed suitabilities and all thresholds considered. Both climatic and remote sensing-based models allowed us to identify the areas with the highest pine species richness based on presence-only data. Remote sensing-based models compare closely with climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and more detailed information on local habitat availability. Main conclusions The results of this case study provide general guidance for the potential and limitations of using remote sensing data in S-SDMs. Our results confirmed that remote sensing data may not only have the capability for improving individual SDMs, but also can be a potential tool for reducing the overestimation of species richness by S-SDMs. This approach opens up new possibilities for species richness predictions in areas where biological survey data are scarce and where no species richness inventory data exist.},

abstract = {I am delighted to introduce this technical report that is an important product for a number of scientists and technicians both within, and outside of, Cefas. lt represents the distillation of knowledge and ideas pertaining to the North Sea marine ecosystem contributed over the past six years from work undertaken both nationally and internationally. This report describes the data sources, assumptions and analyses used in developing representationa l models of the North Sea ecosystem (defined by ICES area lV) for the years 1973 and 1991, and the simulations of changes over space and time. In doing so, it brings together in one source a vast range of data and scientific knowledge that will become a valuable resource to ecologists and modellers alike. The contributions of experts, reflected in the authorship of the individual sections, have been central to ensuring the relevance and high quality of this synthesis. The models presented are just one of the tools needed to support the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management in the North Sea. While the reviews of biological knowledge for each functional group stand alone as useful contributions to knowledge on the North Sea, the added-value comes from the effort to render this information mutually compatible in the framework of an ecosystem model. The need to develop methods and approaches for exploring alternative hypotheses about ecosystem function and response to natural and human-induced change necessitates that such approaches be developed.  The models capture and quantify the trophic structure and energy flows in 68 functional groups including marine mammals, birds, fish, benthos, primary producers and categories of detritus. They also include the landings, discards, and economic and social data for appropriately defined fishing fleets. Hindcaste predictions of changes in the North Sea during the recent past are 'calibrated' against time series data from assessments and scientific survey data.   Based on strong foundations the models are useful tools for exploring dynamic change in ecosystems and macro ecological patterns. The models may be further developed in their application to specific problems such as evaluating the relative influence of climate and fishing on ecosystem change, evaluating the effects of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), predicting fish stock recovery and evaluating harvesting strategies. This technical report is one of a comprehensive series, documenting the data sources and construction of ecosystem models of UK shelf seas. Previously published reports and models exist for the North Sea, Channel (combined for both Eastern and Western), Western Channel, lrish Sea, West of Scotland; with those of the Celtic Sea and Eastern Channel in the later stages of preparation.},

abstract = {Broad-scale acoustic telemetry networks are being established worldwide. The 10-year anniversary of the Integrated Marine Observing System's Animal Tracking Facility provided the opportunity to assess the efficiency of one of the first national-scale acoustic telemetry networks. Acoustic networks are comprised of acoustic receiver arrays that detect high-frequency transmitters attached to animals that pass within detection range. Herein we assessed the efficiency of eight curtains to detect passing animals by calculating the standardised mean number of detections and transmitters detected at each station. The aim was to determine how many receivers could be decommissioned from each curtain while maintaining its integrity (i.e. detection of all species passing the array). Pivotal locations were defined as the furthest station at which all species would still be detected and where at least 75{\%} of the detections and transmitters would still be detected. By applying these criteria, we were able to improve the cost-effectiveness of our network significantly, reducing the number of stations from 132 to 85 (64{\%} of the original network), yet still retaining 84{\%} of total detections, 86{\%} of transmitters and 100{\%} of detected species. The present study provides a useful framework for refining acoustic telemetry networks.},

abstract = {Uncertainties in biomass estimates in Amazonian forests result in a broad range of possible magnitude for the emissions of carbon from deforestation and other land-use changes. This paper presents biomass equations developed from trees directly weighed in open forest on fertile soils in the southern Amazon (SA) and allometric equations for bole-volume estimates of trees in both dense and open forests. The equations were used to improve the commonly used biomass models based on large-scale wood-volume inventories carried out in Amazonian forest. The biomass estimates from the SA allometric equation indicate that equations developed in forests on infertile soils in central Amazonia (CA) result in overestimates if applied to trees in the open forests of SA. All aboveground components of 267 trees in open forests of SA were cut and weighed, and the proportion of the biomass stored in the crowns of trees in open forest was found to be higher than in dense forest. In the case of inventoried wood volume, corrections were applied for indentations and hollow trunks and it was determined that no adjustment is needed for the form factor used in the RadamBrasil volume formula. New values are suggested for use in models to convert wood volume to biomass estimates. A biomass map for Brazilian Amazonia was produced from 2702 plots inventoried by the RadamBrasil Project incorporating all corrections for wood density and wood volume and in factors used to add the bole volume of small trees and the crown biomass. Considering all adjustments, the biomass map indicates total biomass of 123.1 Gt (1 Gt = 1 billion tons) dry weight (aboveground + belowground) for originally forested areas in 1976 in the Brazilian Legal Amazon as a whole (102.3 Gt for aboveground only) at the time of the RadamBrasil inventories, which were carried out before intensive deforestation had occurred in the region. Excluded from this estimate are 529,000 km2 of forest lacking sufficient RadamBrasil inventory data. After forest losses of 676,000 km2 by 2006 - not counting 175,000 km2 of this deforested area lacking RadamBrasil data - the estimated dry biomass stock was reduced to 105.4 and 87.6 Gt (aboveground + belowground and only above-ground). Thus, in 2006 the carbon storage in forested areas in Brazilian Amazonia as a whole will be around 51.1 Gt (assuming 1 Mg dry biomass = 0.485 Mg C). Biomass estimates by forest type (aggregated into 12 vegetation classes) are provided for each state in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The stimulation of plant growth by elevated CO2 concentration has been widely observed. Such fertilization, and associated carbon storage, could dampen future increases in atmospheric CO2 levels and associated climate warming1. However, the CO2 fertilization of plant biomass may be sensitive to nitrogen supply2–4. Herein we show that in the latest decade of a long-term perennial grassland experiment, low ambient soil nitrogen availability constrained the positive response of plant biomass to elevated CO2, a result not seen in the first years (1998–2000) of the study. From 2001 to 2010, elevated CO2 stimulated plant biomass half as much under ambient as under enriched nitrogen supply, an effect mirrored over this period by more positive effects of elevated CO2 on soil nitrogen supply (net nitrogen mineralization) and plant nitrogen status under enriched than ambient nitrogen supply. The results did not strongly support either the progressive nitrogen limitation hypothesis, or the alternative hypothesis of priming of soil nitrogen release by elevated CO2. As nitrogen limitation to productivity is widespread, persistent nitrogen constraints on terrestrial responses to rising CO2 are probably pervasive. Further incorporation of such interactions into Earth system models is recommended to better predict future CO2 fertilization effects and impacts on the global carbon cycle.},

abstract = {A detailed study of montane and lowland forest areas at 1710 and 380 m respectively is presented; supporting data from three other lowland forests are also given. 1. The soils under the forests are compared. The montane is appreciably more acid in the A1 horizon, has a lower calcium-status, contains more organic matter, has a coarser texture and has freer drainage. 2. The forests are shown to be very similar in structure. The montane forest is somewhat less dense (Table 2), and the trees are of slightly lesser mean height and diameter (Table 3), but there is not much difference in the extent of the canopy holes. Concerning undergrowth plants (Table 4), the montane plot bore fewer saplings and poles (woody plants 3-9 ft, 9-20 ft) but far more cyclanths and palms. The data from the extra lowland plots indicate that the plot studied in detail was essentially typical of forest over a wide area in eastern Ecuador. 3. The stratification of forests is analysed more closely than by other workers and various types are distinguished. It is concluded that stratification of species has not been shown for any species-rich primary tropical lowland rain forest. Stratification of the heights of individuals and of canopy volume or mass is related to species-paucity and to the regeneration pattern. Other forms of stratification are briefly discussed. The montane forest shows no stratification of individuals or, over the whole plot, of canopy volume. No regular strata of individuals have been located in the four lowland forests (cf. Fig. 4). 4. Various evidence is used to show that all the forests investigated are either primary or very old secondary. 5. The leaf size spectra of the montane and lowland forests are similar but the montane has less macrophylls and more notophylls and microphylls. The montane forest has shorter buttresses, more leaning and distorted boles, and less monopodial crowns. 6. Both forests have strong floristic affinities (at the family level) with the Amazonian hylaea; the montane forest also contains a distinctly Andean element. 7. A revised system of synusiae of epiphytes and climbers is presented, together with a detailed analysis of the numbers of species and individuals in different taxonomic groups and arbitrary height classes in the two forest types. The montane forest has a greater abundance of skiophytic bryophytes, pteridophytes, bromeliads, and orchids and of photophytic bryophytes and macrolichens. The lowland forest has more photophytic dicotyledonous climbers and more climbing and epiphytic Araceae. 8. The classification of tropical rain forests is discussed and the three formation-types recognized by Richards (1952) are renamed Lowland Rain forest, Lower Montane Rain forest and Upper Montane Rain forest. The montane forest studied is assigned to the Lower Montane Rain forest formation-type and the lowland forests to the Lowland Rain forest formation-type. The limitations of a single system of formation-types for the whole of the tropics are emphasized.},

Currently, variants of the sequential extraction procedure developed by M. J. Hedley and co-workers afford the greatest discrimination among labile and non-labile organic and inorganic P pools. Results of recent studies that used this technique to evaluate P fractions in forest soils indicate the following: (1) in intact, highly weathered forest soils of the humid tropics, Hedley-labile P values are several times larger than extractable P values resulting from mildly acidic extracting solutions which were commonly used in the past 2 decades; (2) pools of Hedley-labile P are several times larger than the annual forest P requirement and P required from the soil annually in both temperate and tropical forests; (3) long-term trends in non-labile P pools during pedogenesis are adequately represented by the Walker and Syers' model of changes in P fractionation during soil development. However, to better represent trends in pools that can supply plant-available P across forest soils of different age and weathering status, the paradigm should be modified; and (4) across a wide range of tropical and temperate forest soils, organic matter content is an important determinant of Hedley-labile P.},

abstract = {Downstream migration of Anguilla anguilla silver eels was studied in the Lower Rhine, Germany, and the Rhine Delta, The Netherlands, in 2004-2006. Fish (n = 457) released near Cologne with implanted transponders were tracked by remote telemetry at 12 fixed detection locations distributed along the different possible migration routes to the North Sea. Relatively more A. anguilla migrated via the Waal than the Nederrijn, as would be expected from the ratio of river discharges at the bifurcation point at Pannerden. Downstream migration from the release site to Rhine-Xanten, close to the German-Dutch border, generally occurred in the autumn of the year of release but migration speeds tended to be low and variable and unaffected by maturation status or river discharge rates. Detection frequencies were not significantly related to discharge peaks or lunar cycles, but there was a minor detection peak 1-6 h after sunset. Between 2004 and 2009, 43{\%} of the 457 A. anguilla released were never detected and of the 260 detected entering the Netherlands, 83 (32{\%}) were detected escaping to the sea, 78 (94{\%}) via the Nieuwe Waterweg and three (4{\%}) and two (2{\%}) via the sluices in the Haringvlietdam and Afsluitdijk, respectively. Possible causes of non-detections are discussed and it is suggested that many A. anguilla temporarily ceased migration, but that fishing mortality could have been important during passage through the Dutch parts of the Rhine. Practical implications of the results for predicting emigration routes, timings and magnitudes and use in management initiatives to promote escapement of A. anguilla silver eels to the sea are critically discussed.},

Starting from the stated model purpose, a weighted dimensionless cost function is set up that attributes equal weight to the vertical and the horizontal tide. By adapting the bottom roughness, the cost function is minimized during model calibration. Quantification of the model skill and cost function calculation is done using the VIMM toolbox which is developed and maintained at Flanders Hydraulics Research. The quantified model skill of the SCALDIS model shows that the model is well suited to assess the effects of changing the bathymetry and geometry of the Scheldt river on water levels, velocities, tracer dispersion and residence times, and that the hydrodynamics can be used as the basis for sediment transport calculations (both cohesive and non-cohesive).},

abstract = {In this article, we present an approach based on generalized additive models (GAMs) to predict species' distributions and abundance in Florida estuaries with habitat suitability modeling. Environmental data gathered by fisheries-independent monitoring in Tampa Bay from 1998 to 2008 were interpolated to create seasonal habitat maps for temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen and annual maps for depth and bottom type. We used delta-GAM models assuming either zero-adjusted gamma or beta-inflated-at-zero distributions to predict catch per unit effort (CPUE) from five habitat variables plus gear type for each estuarine species by life stage and season. Bottom type and gear type were treated as categorical predictors with reference parameterization. Three spline-fitting procedures (the penalized B-spline, cubic smoothing spline, and restricted cubic spline) were applied to the continuous predictors. Two additive, linear submodels on the log and logistic scales were used to predict CPUEs {\textgreater}0 and CPUEs = 0, respectively, across environmental gradients. The best overall model among those estimated was identified based on the lowest Akaike information criterion. A stepwise routine was used to omit continuous predictors that had little predictive power. The model developed was then applied to interpolated habitat data to predict CPUEs across the estuary using GIS. The statistical models, coupled with the use of GIS, provide a method for predicting spatial distributions and population numbers of estuarine species' life stages. An example is presented for juvenile pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum during the summer in Tampa Bay, Florida.},

abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide records indicate that the land surface has acted as a strong global carbon sink over recent decades1,2 , with a substantial fraction of this sink probably located in the tropics3 , particularly in the Amazon4 . Nevertheless, it is unclear how the ter- restrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric compo- sition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three dec- ades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirmsthatAmazonforests have acted as a long-termnet biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined byone-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s.This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mor- tality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase includegreater climate variability,andfeedbacks of faster growthon mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity5 . The observed de- cline of theAmazonsink divergesmarkedly fromthe recent increase in terrestrial carbon uptake at the global scale1,2 , and is contrary to expectations based on models6},

abstract = {In the last decades, aquatic habitat modelling has gained more attention due to its relevance to river management, restoration and conservation biology. Although numerous habitat suitability models have been developed based on ecological data, data quality is often a key, but overlooked issue in the development of such models. This paper analysed the impact of sampling efficiency on the quality of data-driven habitat suitability models. Therefore, models were derived from fish habitat data obtained from two sampling techniques with contrasting efficiency: electrofishing and radio telemetry. Specifically, we developed habitat models for burbot (Lota lota L.) in the River Grote Nete based on radio telemetry data and electrofishing data and compared the performance and ecological relevance of these models. Although both electrofishing and telemetry models selected the presence of hollow banks as the most important input variable, the telemetry models performed substantially better than the electrofishing models. Further, the telemetry models also better reflected the observed burbot habitat preferences within the study area. These telemetry models indicated that burbot prefers hollow banks and that depth and flow velocity conditions in the study area were not limiting for burbot. The presented approach may contribute to the development of more reliable and ecologically relevant habitat suitability models. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We studied the spatial heterogeneity of tree diversity, and of forest structure and productivity in a highly diverse tropical mountain area in southern Ecuador with the aim of understanding the causes of the large variation in these parameters. Two major environmental gradients, elevation and topography, representing a broad range of climatic and edaphic site conditions, were analyzed.Wefound the highest species richness of trees in valleys o2100 m. Valleys showed highest values of basal area, leaf area index and tree basal area increment as well. Tree diversity also increased from ridges to valleys, while canopy openness decreased. Significant relationships existed between tree diversity and soil parameters (pH, total contents of Mg, K, Ca,Nand P), and between diversity and the spatial variability of pH and Ca andMg contents suggesting a dependence of tree diversity on both absolute levels and on the small-scale heterogeneity of soil nutrient availability. Tree diversity and basal area in- crement were positively correlated, partly because both are similarly affected by soil conditions. We conclude that the extraordinarily high tree species richness in the area is primarily caused by three factors: (1) the existence of steep altitudinal and topographic gradients in a rather limited area creating a small-scale mosaic of edaphically different habitats; (2) the intermingling of Amazonian lowland plant species, that reach their upper distribution limits, and of montane forest species; and (3) the geographical position of the study area between the humid eastern Andean slope and the dry interandean forests of South Ecuador.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic simulation of estuaries requires a single digital elevation model (DEM) resulting from merging of both topographic and bathymetric data. These two datasets are usually produced using different technologies, co-ordinate systems and datums. Intertidal data in particular are often lacking due to the difficulty of data acquisition using conventional survey techniques. This paper presents a fast, accurate and low-cost methodology to fill this gap and highlights the effect of the digital elevation model characteristics, such as the interpolation method and spatial resolution, on modelled water levels and flooded areas. The Lima river estuary, located in North-western Portugal, is used as a case study. Validation tests for commonly available spatial interpolators showed ordinary kriging to be the most adequate interpolator. Digital elevation models with regular grids of 5. m and 50. m resolution were used, together with the original (not interpolated) elevation dataset, as input to a finite element hydrodynamic model for astronomic tide simulation. Results indicate that the larger differences between using different elevation models occur at low tide during spring tide, marginally impacting the flood modelling. The effect of a vertical offset of the chart datum with respect to a part of the digital elevation model was finally investigated, showing a limited influence in the determination of the water levels. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The North Sea and the Baltic Sea ecosystems differ substantially in both hydrology and biogeochemical processes. Nonetheless, both systems are closely linked to each other and a coupled modeling approach is indispensable when aiming to simulate and understand long-term ecosystem dynamics in both seas. In this study, we present first an updated version of the fully coupled bio-physical model ECOSMO, a 3d hydrodynamic and a N(utrient)P(hytoplankton)Z(ooplankton)D(etritus) model, which is now adopted to the coupled system North Sea-Baltic Sea. To make the model applicable to both ecosystems, processes relevant for the Baltic Sea (e.g. sedimentation, cyanobacteria) were incorporated into the model formulation. Secondly we assess the validity of the model to describe seasonal, inter-annual and decadal variations in both seas. Our analyses show that the model sufficiently represents the spatial and temporal dynamics in both ecosystems but with some uncertainties in the coastal areas of the North Sea, likely related to the missing representation of tidal flats in the model, and in the deep-water nutrient pool of the Baltic Sea. Finally we present results from a 61-year (1948-2008) hindcast of the coupled North Sea and Baltic Sea ecosystem and identify long-term changes in primary and secondary production. The simulated long-term dynamics of primary and secondary production could be corroborated by observations from available literature and shows a general increase in the last three decades of the simulation when compared to the first 30. years. Regime shifts could be identified for both ecosystems, but with differences in both, timing and magnitude of the related change. •With ECOSMO II a consistent 3d biophysical NPZD model for the coupled North Sea and Baltic Sea system is presented.•Model results are thoroughly validated against available observational data sets.•Model performance on seasonal, inter-annual and up to decadal time scales could be demonstrated.•A consistent multi-decadal simulation for lower trophic level ecosystem dynamics in the coupled ecosystem was analyzed.•Ecological regime shifts are identified for North Sea and Baltic Sea, but with differences in timing and magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Simplifying models by using coarse spatial resolution can be desirable because it reduces structural, computational and data requirements and can make model interpretation easier. However, spatially simplified models may be incapable of reproducing important dynamics observed in nature. To consider this issue the effect of spatial structure on the output of two trophic ecosystem models (Bay Model 2 (BM2) and the Integrated Generic Bay Ecosystem Model (IGBEM)) was considered using a theoretical approach known as 'deep-shallow model' comparison. This involved comparing simulation runs of 1-, 3-, and 8-box versions of the ecosystem models (the 'shallow' models) with a 59-box version that was used to represent the real world (the 'deep' model). The results indicate that simpler spatial configurations (geometries) can result in less short-term variation, changes in predicted spatial patterns and trophic self-simplification (loss of functional groups), as the opportunity for spatial refuges is reduced. More importantly, models with very little spatial resolution (i.e. 1- and 3-box models) do not capture the effects of changes in nutrient loads or fishing pressure as well as more complex models. The results for the 8-box models used here indicate that some simplification is acceptable, as overall model performance is not overwhelmed by the impacts of trophic self-simplification and a loss of spatial heterogeneity. However, using models with very little spatial resolution (i.e. 1- and 3-box models) can be misleading, as the impacts on system dynamics of the reduced heterogeneity increase. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Nearly every aspect of the cloud forest is affected by regular cloud immersion, from the hydrological cycle to the species of plants and animals within the forest. Since the altitude band of cloud formation on tropical mountains is limited, the tropical montane cloud forest occurs in fragmented strips and has been likened to island archipelagoes. This isolation and uniqueness promotes explosive speciation, exceptionally high endemism, and a great sensitivity to climate. Global climate change threatens all ecosystems through temperature and rainfall changes, with a typical estimate for altitude shifts in the climatic optimum for mountain ecotones of hundreds of meters by the time of CO2 doubling. This alone suggests complete replacement of many of the narrow altitude range cloud forests by lower altitude ecosystems, as well as the expulsion of peak residing cloud forests into extinction. However, the cloud forest will also be affected by other climate changes, in particular changes in cloud formation. A number of global climate models suggest a reduction in low level cloudiness with the coming climate changes, and one site in particular, Monteverde, Costa Rica, appears to already be experiencing a reduction in cloud immersion. The coming climate changes appear very likely to upset the current dynamic equilibrium of the cloud forest. Results will include biodiversity loss, altitude shifts in species' ranges and subsequent community reshuffling, and possibly forest death. Difficulties for cloud forest species to survive in climate-induced migrations include no remaining location with a suitable climate, no pristine location to colonize, migration rates or establishment rates that cannot keep up with climate change rates and new species interactions. We review previous cloud forest species redistributions in the paleo-record in light of the coming changes. The characteristic epiphytes of the cloud forest play an important role in the light, hydrological and nutrient cycles of the cloud forest and are especially sensitive to atmospheric climate change, especially humidity, as the epiphytes can occupy incredibly small eco-niches from the canopy to crooks to trunks. Even slight shifts in climate can cause wilting or death to the epiphyte community. Similarly, recent cloud forest animal redistributions, notably frog and lizard disappearances, may be driven by climate changes. Death of animals or epiphytes may have cascading effects on the cloud forest web of life. Aside from changes in temperature, precipitation, and cloudiness, other climate changes may include increasing dry seasons, droughts, hurricanes and intense rain storms, all of which might increase damage to the cloud forest. Because cloud forest species occupy such small areas and tight ecological niches, they are not likely to colonize damaged regions. Fire, drought and plant invasions (especially non-native plants) are likely to increase the effects of any climate change damage in the cloud forest. As has frequently been suggested in the literature, all of the above factors combine to make the cloud forest a likely site for observing climate change effects in the near future.

abstract = {The implicit hydrologic dimensions of international efforts to mitigate climate change, specifically potential impacts of the Clean Development Mechanism-Afforestation/Reforestation (CDM-AR) provisions of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) on global, regional and local water cycles, are examined. The global impact of the redistribution of water use driven by agriculture and land use change, of which CDM-AR can be a contributing factor, is a major component of ongoing global change and climate change processes. If converted to forest, large areas deemed suitable for CDM-AR would exhibit increases in actual evapotranspiration (AET) and/or decreases in runoff. Almost 20{\%} (144 Mha) of all suitable land showed little or no impact on runoff and another 28{\%} (210 Mha) showed only moderate impact. About 27{\%} (200 Mha) was in the highest impact class, exhibiting an 80–100{\%} decrease in runoff, and prevalent in drier areas (based on Aridity Index (AI)), the semi-arid tropics, and in conversion from grasslands and subsistence agriculture. Significant impacts on local hydrologic cycles were evident, however large impacts were not predicted at regional or global scale due primarily to the current limit on carbon offset projects under the Kyoto Protocol. Predicted decreases in runoff ranged from 54{\%} in drier areas to less than 15{\%} in more humid areas, based on four case studies located across a range of biophysical conditions and project scenarios in Ecuador and Bolivia. Factors other than climate, e.g. upstream/ downstream position, were shown to be important in evaluating off-site impacts. This study demonstrates that it will become increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional water resources, and how the hydrologic dimension of CDM-AR impacts on issues of sustainability, local communities, and food security. {\#} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper examines efficient and decentralized monitoring of objects moving in a transportation network. Previous work in moving object monitoring has focused primarily on centralized information systems, like moving object databases and geographic information systems. In contrast, in this paper monitoring is in-network, requiring no centralized control and allowing for substantial spatial constraints to the movement of information. The transportation network is assumed to be augmented with fixed checkpoints that can detect passing mobile objects. This assumption is motivated by many practical applications, from traffic management in vehicle ad hoc networks to habitat monitoring by tracking animal movements. In this context, this paper proposes and evaluates a family of efficient decentralized algorithms for capturing, storing and querying the movements of objects. The algorithms differ in the restrictions they make on the communication and sensing constraints to the mobile nodes and the fixed checkpoints. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated and compared with respect to their scalability (in terms of communication and space complexity), and their latency (the time between when a movement event occurs, and when all interested nodes are updated with records about that event). The conclusions identify three key principles for efficient decentralized monitoring of objects moving past checkpoints: structuring computation around neighboring checkpoints; taking advantage of mobility diffusion and separating the generation and querying of movement information.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to predict the future distribution of an invasive macroinvertebrate species, Dikerogammarus villosus, under changing environmental conditions. For this, we used an integrated modelling approach. First, a habitat suitability model (HSM) was constructed on the basis of a regression tree model, to determine the preferred chemical water quality conditions. Subsequently, this HSM was combined with a chemical water quality model that makes predictions on future water quality scenarios for the year 2015 and 2027. It was expected that the area of suitable habitat of D. villosus would increase with improving water quality conditions in the future. Finally, migration speed was incorporated to model the spatial-temporal spread of D. villosus based on a network analysis. On the basis of monitoring data of Flanders (Belgium), it was calculated that D. villosus is able to spread with an average speed of 5 km year(-1).The model simulations indicate that the species is primarily present in large rivers and canals with a good chemical water quality. With improving water quality, the species will be able to colonize additional watercourses, mainly because of a decrease in chemical oxygen demand and orthophosphate concentration. A validation based on the observed occurrence shows that the model accurately predicts areas with a high suitability that are most likely to be invaded by D. villosus. Our integrated modelling approach is useful as a practical method to perform risk assessment for watercourses that are vulnerable to invasions not only in Flanders but also in the whole world.

Models were evaluated using three approaches: (1) examination of explained deviance; (2) four-fold cross-valN1ation using the model calibration data; and (3) comparison of predicted and observed values for independent grN1 cells in eastern Finland. The model accuracy for approaches (2) and (3) was measured using the area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic plot. Results At 10-km resolution, inclusion of the distribution of woodpeckers as a predictor variable significantly improved the explanatory power, cross-valN1ation statistics and the predictive accuracy of the models. Inclusion of land cover led to similar improvements at 10-km resolution, although these improvements were less apparent at 40-km resolution for both land cover and biotic interactions. Main conclusions Predictions of species distributions at macro-scales may be significantly improved by incorporating biotic interactions and land cover variables into models. Our results are important for models used to predict the impacts of climate change, and emphasize the need for comprehensive evaluation of the reliability of species-climate impact models},

abstract = {This Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups (WGs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It provides an integrated view of cli- mate change as the final part of the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Re- port (AR4). Topic 1 summarises observed changes in climate and their ef- fects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes, while Topic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes. Topic 3 pre- sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un- der different scenarios. Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop- ment. Topic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per- spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain- ing key uncertainties in this assessment. A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

abstract = {The German-Dutch project “Rhine Silver Eel” started in 2004 and focuses at quantification of the female silver eel escapement of the whole Rhine system, the largest West-European river basin, by mark recapture and telemetry. By using telemetry the migration pathways of the downstream migrating eels released in Cologne (300-350 km from the sea, depending on the migration route) were tracked in the three main branches of the Rhine (Waal, Nederrijn/Lek, IJssel + Lake IJsselmeer) and in the complex network of river branches of the Rhine delta. Over 3,000 female silver eels {\textgreater} 50 cm were marked and released in Cologne in 2004 and in 2005, more than 4,000 and 6,000 respectively were checked for marks in the different Rhine branches close to the sea and 6 and 5 eels were recaptured in these years. Estimates of the population size of the downstream migrating female ({\textgreater} 50 cm) Rhine silver eel population in 2004 and 2005 were at most 2.0.106 and 3.5.106 respectively with corresponding biomasses of 1.0.106 and 1.9.106 kg and 95{\%} confidence levels in the same order of magnitude. The silver eels migrated all day long and only in 2005 seemed to peak in migrational activity in the early evening. Downstream migration up to the sea took less than 2 days up to more than one year and generally occurred in October and November of the year of release. Most of the escapees seem to find their way to the sea via the Nieuwe Waterweg and not via Lake IJsselmeer or Haringvliet. The total percentage of escapees is 34{\%} of the migrating eels of the 2004 cohort and 27{\%} of the 2005 cohort (both up to 2006) passing Xanten. The telemetry data suggest that the Nederrijn/Lek, the only location where hydropower stations have been built in the lower Rhine system, might be relevant for downstream migration of eels only in years with higher discharges.},

abstract = {This book provides a first synthetic view of an emerging area of ecology and biogeography, linking individual- and population-level processes to geographic distributions and biodiversity patterns. Problems in evolutionary ecology, macroecology, and biogeography are illuminated by this integrative view. The book focuses on correlative approaches known as ecological niche modeling, species distribution modeling, or habitat suitability modeling, which use associations between known occurrences of species and environmental variables to identify environmental conditions under which populations can be maintained. The spatial distribution of environments suitable for the species can then be estimated: a potential distribution for the species. This approach has broad applicability to ecology, evolution, biogeography, and conservation biology, as well as to understanding the geographic potential of invasive species and infectious diseases, and the biological implications of climate change. The authors lay out conceptual foundations and general principles for understanding and interpreting species distributions with respect to geography and environment. Focus is on development of niche models. While serving as a guide for students and researchers, the book also provides a theoretical framework to support future progress in the field.},

abstract = {It has been long recognised that dispersal is an important life-history trait that plays a key role in the demography and evolution of populations and species. This then suggests that dispersal play a central role in the response of populations and species to ever-increasing global change, including climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, and biological invasions. During a symposium held at Lund University (Sweden), the causes and consequences of dispersal were discussed, and here we provide an overview of the talks. As the discussions often gravitated towards the role and our understanding of dispersal in a changing world and given the urgent challenges posed by it, we place this overview in the context of global change. We draw and discuss four conclusions: (i) methodological advances provide opportunities for improved future studies, (ii) dispersal distances can be much greater than previously thought (examples in plants and vertebrates), but also much more restricted (examples in micro-organisms), (iii) dispersal is more dynamic than we often care to admit (e.g. due to individual variation, effects of parasites, variation in life history, developmental and evolutionary responses, community impacts), (iv) using results of dispersal research for detailed prediction of outcomes under global change is currently mostly out of reach - nevertheless, that should not stop us from showing the many negative consequences of global change, and how dispersal is often a limiting factor in adapting to this.},

abstract = {Tropical regions are facing increasing atmospheric inputs of nutrients, which will have unknown consequences for the structure and functioning of these systems. Here, we show that Neotropical montane rainforests respond rapidly to moderate additions of N (50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and P (10 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Monitoring of nutrient fluxes demonstrated that the majority of added nutrients remained in the system, in either soil or vegetation. N and P additions led to not only an increase in foliar N and P concentrations, but also altered soil microbial biomass, standing fine root biomass, stem growth, and litterfall. The different effects suggest that trees are primarily limited by P, whereas some processes-notably aboveground productivity--are limited by both N and P. Highly variable and partly contrasting responses of different tree species suggest marked changes in species composition and diversity of these forests by nutrient inputs in the long term. The unexpectedly fast response of the ecosystem to moderate nutrient additions suggests high vulnerability of tropical montane forests to the expected increase in nutrient inputs.},

abstract = {Advances in sensor design and data analysis techniques are making remote sensing systems practical and attractive for use in research and management of coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands, estuaries, and coral reefs. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagers are available for mapping coastal land cover, concentrations of organic/inorganic suspended particles, and dissolved substances in coastal waters. Thermal infrared scanners can map sea surface temperatures accurately and chart coastal currents, while microwave radiometers can measure ocean salinity, soil moisture, and other hydrologic parameters. Radar imagers, scatterometers, and altimeters provide information on ocean waves, ocean winds, sea surface height, and coastal currents, which strongly influence coastal ecosystems. Using airborne light detecting and ranging systems, one can produce bathymetric maps, even inmoderately turbid coastal waters. Since coastal ecosystems have high spatial complexity and temporal variability, they frequently have to be observed from both satellite and aircraft in order to obtain the required spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. A reliable field data collection approach using ships, buoys, and field instruments with a valid sampling scheme is required to calibrate and validate the remotely sensed information. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of practical remote sensing techniques that can be used in studies of coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Economic growth is often based on the intensification of crop production, energy consumption and urbanization. In many cases, this leads to the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Modelling water resources and the related identification of key drivers of change are essential to improve and protect water quality in river basins. This study evaluates the potential of Bayesian belief network models to predict the ecological water quality in a typical multifunctional and tropical river basin. Field data, expert knowledge and literature data were used to develop a set of Bayesian belief network models. The developed models were evaluated based on weighted Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa${\textless}inf{\textgreater}w{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI) and spherical payoff. On top, a sensitivity analysis and practical simulation tests of the two most reliable models were performed. Cross-validation based on $\kappa${\textless}inf{\textgreater}w{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (Model 1: 0.44±0.08; Model 2: 0.44±0.11) and CCI (Model 1: 36.3±2.3; Model 2: 41.6±2.3) indicated that the performance was reliable and stable. Model 1 comprised of input variables main land use, elevation, sediment type, chlorophyll, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand; whereas Model 2 did not include dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand. Although the predictive performance of Model 2 was slightly higher than that of Model 1, simulation outcomes of Model 1 were more coherent. Additionally, more management options could be evaluated with Model 1. As the model's ability to simulate management outcomes is of utmost importance in model selection, Model 1 is recommended as a tool to support decision-making in river management. Model predictions and sensitivity analysis indicated that flow velocity is the major variable determining ecological water quality and suggested that construction of additional dams and water abstraction within the basin would have an adverse effect on water quality. Although a case study in a single river basin is presented, the modelling approach can be of general use on any other river basin.},

abstract = {This paper contains a strategy for estimating total aboveground biomass of tropical forests. We developed regression equations to estimate aboveground biomass of individual trees as a function of diameter at breast height, total height, wood density, and Holdridge life zone (sensu Holdridge 1967). The regressions are applied to some 5,300 trees from 43 independent sample plots, and 101 stand tables from large-scale forest inventories in four countries, to estimate commercial and total aboveground biomass per unit area by forest type, and to estimate expansion factors defined as the ratio of aboveground to commercial biomass. The quadratic stand diameter (QSD, i.e., the diameter of a tree of average basal area) in a given forest stand influences the magnitude of the expansion factor. Stands of small trees have large expansion factors (up to 6.4), and as QSD increases, the expansion factor decreases to a constant value (about 1.75). For undisturbed forests in moist, moist transition to dry, and dry life zones respectively, the expansion factors for total aboveground biomass were 1.74, 1.95, and 1.57 respectively. For undisturbed, logged, and nonproductive forest categories used by the FAO to report global commercial wood volume data, we estimated expansion factors of 1.75, 1.90, and 2.00 respectively. Applying these factors to FAO data results in a 28 to 47{\%} increase in previous volume-derived estimates of tropical forest biomass. However, estimates of tropical forest biomass based on small destructive samples continue to be high relative to estimates based on volume data.},

abstract = {This study presents a global analysis of forest cover and forest protection. An updated Global Forest Map (using MODIS2005) provided a current assessment of forest cover within 20 natural forest types. This map was overlaid onto WWF realms and ecoregions to gain additional biogeographic information on forest distribution. Using the 2008 World Database on Protected Areas, percentage forest cover protection was calculated globally, within forest types, realms and ecoregions, and within selected areas of global conservation importance. At the 10{\%} tree cover threshold, global forest cover was 39 million km2. Of this, 7.7{\%} fell within protected areas under IUCN management categories I-IV. With the inclusion of IUCN categories V and VI, the level of global forest protection increased to 13.5{\%}. Percentage forest protection (IUCN I-IV) varied greatly between realms from 5.5{\%} (Palearctic) to 13.4{\%} (Australasia), and for forest types from 3.2{\%} (temperate freshwater swamp forest) to 28{\%} (temperate broadleaf evergreen forest). Median protection of forest cover in 670 ecoregions (forest above a specified threshold) was 5.9{\%} (IUCN I-IV); at IUCN I-VI, 46{\%} of the ecoregions had less than 10{\%} forest protection. Considering their biodiversity importance, forest protection within global priority areas was insufficient, e.g., median protection of 8.4{\%} in biodiversity hotspots (IUCN I-IV). Results have policy relevance in terms of the target of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), reconfirmed in 2008, to effectively conserve "at least 10{\%} of each of the world's forest types".

The group suggested that a science-based “pop-doc” would be an effective initial action to remedy this. What follows is a response to that recommendation. It documents some of the scientific information that will be of interest to other scientists and managers of TMCF, but not overwhelming for a lay reader who is seeking to become more informed about these remarkable ecosystems. The purpose of this booklet, therefore, is to: - Impart an understanding of what these TMCFs are and how they function, based on the best science currently available, incomplete though that information is; - Engender an appreciation of the values of TMCFs and why they are important to humans and our biological consorts on this planet Earth; - Develop an awareness of the forces that threaten these ecosystems and cause the losses that are resulting from our resource development activities; - Arouse a concern that will influence the way and speed with which research, management, protection and policy are carried out. Donor institutions and development agencies are especially invited to read this document. Conservation NGOs are urged to use this information to raise awareness among the stakeholders in TMCFs, and to work with decision-makers in halting the degradation and disappearance of these valuable and unusual forests. Information about the TMCF Initiative and the supportive organizations that made this booklet possible, is given on the final page. We believe decision time for cloud forests is here.

Ordinary kriging was then shown to be effective in$\backslash$nimproving the spatial resolution of the MODIS/Terra image-based$\backslash$nestimation of the TSS concentration at a 250 m interval, because it$\backslash$ncould detect TSS variation in detail, in particular in the local$\backslash$nestuaries. TSS distributions derived from 12 MODIS/Terra images from$\backslash$nNovember 2009 to October 2010 clarified seasonal changes in TSS during$\backslash$none year. TSS concentrations were high during summer and lower during$\backslash$nfall and winter. Such trends were conformable with the hydrodynamics in$\backslash$nTien Yen Bay. Consequently, the proposed method was more effective for$\backslash$nTSS estimation than traditional methods using satellite image data only.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic marine debris, mainly of plastic origin, is accumulating in estuarine and coastal environments around the world causing damage to fauna, flora and habitats. Plastics also have the potential to accumulate in the food web, as well as causing economic losses to tourism and sea-going industries. If we are to manage this increasing threat, we must first understand where debris is accumulating and why these locations are different to others that do not accumulate large amounts of marine debris. This paper demonstrates an advection-diffusion model that includes beaching, settling, resuspension/re-floating, degradation and topographic effects on the wind in nearshore waters to quantify the relative importance of these physical processes governing plastic debris accumulation. The aim of this paper is to prioritise research that will improve modelling outputs in the future. We have found that the physical characteristic of the source location has by far the largest effect on the fate of the debris. The diffusivity, used to parameterise the sub-grid scale movements, and the relationship between debris resuspension/re-floating from beaches and the wind shadow created by high islands also has a dramatic impact on the modelling results. The rate of degradation of macroplastics into microplastics also have a large influence in the result of the modelling. The other processes presented (settling, wind drift velocity) also help determine the fate of debris, but to a lesser degree. These findings may help prioritise research on physical processes that affect plastic accumulation, leading to more accurate modelling, and subsequently management in the future.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {We have reconstructed the altitudinal position of the upper forest line (UFL) during the last 6000 years. This boundary between montane forest and paramo (tropical alpine grasslands) has important ecological and societal relevance. It is suggested that human-induced fires and deforestation during the long occupation history of the Central Valley of Ecuador have caused a downslope shift of the UFL and have given way to a downslope expansion of paramo vegetation. More recently, montane forests and lower paramo have been replaced to a large extent by agricultural land. Pollen analysis of a 90 cm long sediment core G15-II from a small mire at 3400 m elevation, 200 m below the actual UFL in Guandera Biological Reserve (0 degrees 36' N, 77 degrees 42'E), shows the altitudinal position of the UFL during seven discrete intervals: (1) from 7150 to 6240 cal. yr BP the UFL was at c. 3100-3200 m and climatic conditions were cool; (2) from 6240 to 5320 cal. yr BP the UFL shifted to c. 3600 m and upper montane rainforest (UMRF) surrounded the mire; (3) from 5320 to 2160 cal. yr BP the UFL was at 3600-3650 m elevation and montane forest consisted mainly of Hedyosmum, Weinmannia, Melastomataceae, Ilex, Scrophulariaceae and Symplocos; (4) from 2160 to 910 cal. yr BP the UFL shifted downslope to 3350 m and the mire was located in the lowermost paramo; (5) from 910 to 520 cal. yr BP cooler climatic conditions prevailed and the UFL was at 3250-3300 m; (6) since c. 520 cal. yr BP the UFL has shifted upslope to 3600 m. During this period presence of agricultural weeds (Rumex) and evidence of draining and disturbance of the mire indicate that agricultural activities expanded and almost reached the reserve area; (7) during the last 150 cal. yr disturbance increased. We conclude that during the last 6000 years the UFL reached a maximum altitude of 3650 to 3700 m, indicating that paramo grasslands above this elevation represent a natural ecosystem. Under the Kyoto Protocol-driven reforestation activities, trees should be planted up to a maximum of 3700 m. Planting trees (exotic species in particular) above 3700 m would contribute to the degradation of the natural ecosystem.},

abstract = {Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (−25{\%}) and perennial crops (−30{\%}) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12{\%}. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (−9{\%}) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29{\%}) or under cropland fallow (+32{\%}) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26{\%}). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28{\%}. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.},

abstract = {In aquatic studies, spatial interactions may be both easier to interpret and to quantify by using water distance than by using geographic distance. The water distance is the shortest path between those two sites that may be traversed entirely over water. One problem is that water distances may be non-Euclidean, and thus covariance and variogram functions are not necessarily valid when using the water distance as a distance metric. Another problem is that the computation of water distances for a large set of spatial locations is computationally expensive. Our alternative is a computationally efficient method for calculation of a Euclidean approximation to water distances. The first step of the method is to define a triangular grid covering the complex domain of interest. Using this triangular grid, we pre-compute approximate water distances using a graph search algorithm. These water distances are then approximated by multidimensional scaling, giving a Euclidean space. Finally, we use linear interpolation to move the data locations into the new Euclidean space. By using this method, subsequent computations of water distances between any locations can be done very fast and the method leads to a theoretically valid spatial covariance model. We apply our method to herring data from the Vestfjord system in Northern Norway.},

abstract = {Herbivores are often implicated in the generation of the extraordinarily diverse tropical flora. One hypothesis linking enemies to plant diversification posits that the evolution of novel defenses allows plants to escape their enemies and expand their ranges. When range expansion involves entering a new habitat type, this could accelerate defense evolution if habitats contain different assemblages of herbivores and/or divergent resource availabilities that affect plant defense allocation. We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating two sister habitat specialist ecotypes of Protium subserratum (Burseraceae), a common Amazonian tree that occurs in white-sand and terra firme forests. We collected insect herbivores feeding on the plants, assessed whether growth differences between habitats were genetically based using a reciprocal transplant experiment, and sampled multiple populations of both lineages for defense chemistry. Protium subserratum plants were attacked mainly by chrysomelid beetles and cicadellid hemipterans. Assemblages of insect herbivores were dissimilar between populations of ecotypes from different habitats, as well as from the same habitat 100 km distant. Populations from terra firme habitats grew significantly faster than white-sand populations; they were taller, produced more leaf area, and had more chlorophyll. White-sand populations expressed more dry mass of secondary compounds and accumulated more flavone glycosides and oxidized terpenes, whereas terra firme populations produced a coumaroyl- quinic acid that was absent from white-sand populations. We interpret these results as strong evidence that herbivores and resource availability select for divergent types and amounts of defense investment in white-sand and terra firme lineages of Protium subserratum, which may contribute to habitat-mediated speciation in these trees.

abstract = {Stable carbon isotope composition was determined on leaves of woody plants sampled along an 800-km transect on the western flank of the Rocky Mountains at altitudes ranging from 610 to 2650 m above mean sea level. Discrimination decreased by 1.20 +/- 0.11 parts per thousand (mean +/- 1 SE) per km of altitude (n = 15, F-1,F-13 = 127.8, P {\textless} 0.0001). The change in discrimination was just sufficient to maintain a constant CO2 partial pressure gradient from ambient air to the intercellular spaces within the leaf for both deciduous (P = 0.60) and evergreen (P = 0.90) species. However, the CO2 gradient so maintained was significantly steeper among evergreen (11.31 +/- 0.14 Pa) than among deciduous (9.64 +/- 0.14 Pa) species (t = 8.4, 27 df, P {\textless} 0.0001). As a consequence, the evergreens had lower discrimination than the deciduous species at any given altitude. After the data were corrected for altitude, further analysis revealed significant differences in discrimination and in CO2 partial pressure gradient among species. Thuja plicata (western red-cedar), a scale-leaved evergreen, had lowest mean discrimination (16.67 +/- 0.50 parts per thousand, n = 4) and the steepest CO2 gradient from ambient to intercellular spaces (14.5 +/- 0.5 Pa). Larix occidentalis (western larch), a deciduous conifer, had the highest discrimination (20.95 t 0.34 parts per thousand, n = 9) and the flattest CO2 gradient (8.3 +/- 0.4 Pa), A simple model of water-use efficiency predicted that evergreen species would average 18 +/- 2{\%} higher in water-use efficiency at any given altitude and that mean water-use efficiency would triple across a 2000-m altitude gradient. The difference between evergreen and deciduous species is attributable to variation in the CO2 partial pressure gradient, but the tripling with altitude was almost exclusively a consequence of reduced evaporative demand.},

abstract = {Carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$) has been proposed as a method for evaluating water use efficiency (WUE) in C3 plants and as a precise technique for screening plants with higer tolerance under water deficit conditions. In this research, 18 alfalfa genotypes from different geographical origins were evaluated under irrigated and rain-fed conditions in organically managed fields in Austria. Significant differences were found amongst harvests for $\Delta$-shoot under both conditions while genotype by harvest interaction was only significant under irrigated condition. Drought stress under rain-fed condition reduced the overall mean of water use efficiency and carbon isotope discrimination responses(up to 34{\%}), but the ratios of reduction differed for characters and genotypes. Narrow ranges were found for all traits especially for WUE-TBY (total biomass yield) (0.78kgm−3) and $\Delta$-shoot (0.53‰) based on genotype means over locations and years, although variation and ranges were higher under irrigated condition. Regarding the variable and low correlations, simultaneous assessment of genotypes for $\Delta$-shoot and biomass production can ensure the selection of superior genotypes and minimize potential biomass reductions that may result from using $\Delta$-shoot as the only selection criterion to improve WUE. Sitel was the most water use efficient genotype(2.79 and 4.48kgm−3 based on shoot dry matter and total biomass,respectively) across two condition (widely adapted genotype) followed by Mohajeran, Fix232 and Verko under irrigated condition (as specific adapted genotypes) and Vlasta, Sanditi, Ghara-aghaj under rain-fed condition.},

Outgoing longwave radiation composites are analyzed during periods of strong oceanic forcing to confirm the proposed physical mechanisms. Despite the close proximity to the Pacific, precipitation variability in the Andes of Ecuador is not related to SSTA in the tropical Pacific domain alone. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation influence is most dominant in the northwestern parr of the Andes during December-February (DJF) and in the eastern Cordillera during June-August (JJA) and in both cases associated with below- (above-) average precipitation during El Nino (La Nina) years. During most of the year precipitation variability over the eastern Andes is related to a dipolelike correlation structure in the tropical Atlantic. featuring positive correlations with SSTA to the south of the ITCZ and negative correlations to the north. The proposed mechanism involves positive SSTA in the tropical South Atlantic and contemporaneous negative SSTA in the tropical North Atlantic, resulting in increased rainfall over the eastern Cordillera. The only region with slightly increased precipitation during El Nino events is confined to a narrow area along the western Andean slope between 1 degrees and 3 degrees S in close proximity to the Pacific. However, this relationship is weak. and only apparent in DJF Temperature variability in the Andes can largely be explained by SSTA in the tropical Pacific domain. The temperature response closely follows SSTA in the Nino-3 and Nino-3.4 regions with approximately one-month lag. The northernmost part of the Andes (north of 0.5 degrees N) is the only region where temperatures are significantly correlated with tropical North Atlantic SSTA.},

abstract = {Soil phosphorus pools vary due to changes in the stability of organic matter and secondary Fe and Al oxyhydroxides and non-crystalline aluminosilicate minerals along a climosequence sampled from 85 to 505 cm of annual rainfall in Hawaii. Observations of soil morphology and monthly Eh measurements demonstrate that as annual rainfall increased so does the intensity and duration of reducing conditions in these upland soils. With increased reduction, total phosphorus in the soil declined by nearly two thirds. Modified Hedley sequential fractionation of soil phosphorus provides a measure of plant available and recalcitrant forms of mineral and organically bound phosphorus. With increased rainfall, recalcitrant inorganic phosphorus pools decline in parallel with the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides and amorphous aluminosilicate minerals. In contrast, organically bound phosphorus increases and accounts for a greater fraction of total phosphorus. At the wettest sites, accumulation of organic phosphorus helps to limit overall phosphorus loss. Loss of inorganic phosphorus sorbers starts in soils with moderate reduction whereas the anaerobically driven accumulation of organic matter requires continuously low Eh values. Therefore, in the intermediate rainfall zone where fluctuating oxidizing and reducing conditions prevail, loss of inorganically bound phosphorus is not offset by organically bound phosphorus accumulation. The interaction of these two opposing processes produces a non-linear trend in total phosphorus content. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {To investigate the impact of changing environmental conditions in the North Sea on the distribution and survival of early life stages of a marine fish species, we employed a suite of coupled model components: (i) an Eulerian coupled hydrodynamic/ecosystem (Nutrients, Phyto-, Zooplankton, Detritus) model to provide both 3-D fields of hydrographical properties, and spatially and temporally variable prey fields; (ii) a Lagrangian transport model to simulate temporal changes in cohort distribution; and (iii) an individual-based model (IBM) to depict foraging, growth and survival of fish early life stages. In this application, the IBM was parameterized for sprat (Sprattus sprattus L.) and included non-feeding (egg and yolk-sac larval) stages as well as foraging and growth subroutines for feeding (post-yolk sac) larvae. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the angle of visual acuity, assimilation efficiency and the maximum food consumption rate were the most critical intrinsic model parameters. As an example, we applied this model system for 1990 in the North Sea. Results included not only information concerning the interplay of temperature and prey availability on larval fish survival and growth but also information on mechanisms underlying larval fish aggregation within frontal zones. The good agreement between modelled and in situ estimates of sprat distribution and growth rates in the German Bight suggested that interconnecting these different models provided an expedient tool to scrutinize basic processes in fish population dynamics.},

abstract = {We have high expectations of the world's forest resources. They are to provide renewable raw materials and energy, maintain biological diversity, mitigate climate change, protect land and water resources, provide recreation facilities, improve air quality and help alleviate poverty. At the same time, forests are affected by fire, air pollution, pests and invasive species, and are the primary targets in many countries for agricultural and urban expansion. Competing interests in the benefits of forest resources and forest land are omnipresent, and the need for a sound basis for analysis and conflict resolution has never been greater. The process of global forest resources assessment (FRA) has responded to this challenge. By adopting the concept of sustainable forest management as a reporting framework, FRA is now well placed to provide a holistic perspective on global forest resources, their management and uses. Beyond the conventional production and environmental dimensions of forestry, FRA now includes parameters that are important to forest dwellers and rural poor people, such as the value of non-wood forest products and trends in fuelwood removals. By addressing the thematic elements of sustainable forest management, FRA has evolved into an instrument that is indispensible in international negotiations and arrangements related to forests, and for clarifying the relationship of forestry to sustainable development.},

abstract = {Background: The Amazon to Andes transition zone provides large expanses of relatively pristine forest wilderness across environmental gradients. Such elevational gradients are an excellent natural laboratory for establishing long-term interactions between forest ecosystems and environmental parameters, which is valuable for understanding ecosystem responses to environmental change. Aims: This study presents data on elevational trends of forest structure (biomass, basal area, height, stem density), species richness, and composition from six elevational transects in the Andes. Methods: We analysed the spatial patterns of forest structure, above-ground biomass and composition from 76 permanent plots, ranging from lowland Amazonian rain forest to high-elevation cloud forests in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Results: Forest above-ground woody biomass stocks ranged from 247 Mg ha?1 (Peru, 210 m) to 86 Mg ha?1 (Peru, 3450 m), with significantly decreasing trends of tree height and biomass and an increasing trend of stem density with increasing elevation. We observed an increase in forest richness at three taxonomic levels at mid-elevation, followed by a decrease in richness within the cloud immersion zone. Conclusions: The transects show an increase in stem density, a decline in tree height and above-ground coarse wood biomass and a hump-shaped trend in species richness with increasing elevation. These results suggest that environmental change could lead to significant shifts in the properties of these ecosystems over time.},

abstract = {The identification of core habitat areas and resulting prediction maps are vital tools for land managers. Often, agencies have large datasets from multiple studies over time that could be combined for a more informed and complete picture of a species. Colorado Parks and Wildlife has a large database for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) including 11 radio-telemetry studies completed over 12 years (1997–2008) across northwestern Colorado. We divided the 49,470-km2 study area into 1-km2 grids with the number of sage-grouse locations in each grid cell that contained at least 1 location counted as the response variable. We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using land cover variables as fixed effects and individual birds and populations as random effects to predict greater sage-grouse location counts during breeding, summer, and winter seasons. The mixed effects model enabled us to model correlations that may exist in grouped data (e.g., correlations among individuals and populations). We found only individual groupings accounted for variation in the summer and breeding seasons, but not the winter season. The breeding and summer seasonal models predicted sage-grouse presence in the currently delineated populations for Colorado, but we found little evidence supporting a winter season model. According to our models, about 50{\%} of the study area in Colorado is considered highly or moderately suitable habitat in both the breeding and summer seasons. As oil and gas development and other landscape changes occur in this portion of Colorado, knowledge of where management actions can be accomplished or possible restoration can occur becomes more critical. These seasonal models provide data-driven, distribution maps that managers and biologists can use for identification and exploration when investigating greater sage-grouse issues across the Colorado range. Using historic data for future decisions on species management while accounting for issues found from combining datasets allows land managers the flexibility to use all information available. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract = {A modelling framework for studying the combined effects of climate and land-cover changes on the distribution of species is presented. The model integrates land-cover data into a correlative bioclimatic model in a scale-dependent hierarchical manner, whereby Artificial Neural Networks are used to characterise species' climatic requirements at the European scale and land-cover requirements at the British scale. The model has been tested against an alternative non-hierarchical approach and has been applied to four plant species in Britain: Rhynchospora alba, Erica tetralix, Salix herbacea and Geranium sylvaticum. Predictive performance has been evaluated using Cohen's Kappa statistic and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, and a novel approach to identifying thresholds of occurrence which utilises three levels of confidence has been applied. Results demonstrate reasonable to good predictive performance for each species, with the main patterns of distribution simulated at both 10 km and 1 km resolutions. The incorporation of land-cover data was found to significantly improve purely climate-driven predictions for R. alba and E. tetralix, enabling regions with suitable climate but unsuitable land-cover to be identified. The study thus provides an insight into the roles of climate and land-cover as determinants of species' distributions and it is demonstrated that the modelling approach presented can provide a useful framework for making predictions of distributions under scenarios of changing climate and land-cover type. The paper confirms the potential utility of multi-scale approaches for understanding environmental limitations to species' distributions, and demonstrates that the search for environmental correlates with species' distributions must be addressed at an appropriate spatial scale. Our study contributes to the mounting evidence that hierarchical schemes are characteristic of ecological systems.},

abstract = {Observing spatial and temporal variations of marine biodiversity from non-destructive techniques is central for understanding ecosystem resilience, and for monitoring and assessing conservation strategies, e.g. Marine Protected Areas. Observations are generally obtained through Underwater Visual Censuses (UVC) conducted by divers. The problems inherent to the presence of divers have been discussed in several papers. Video techniques are increasingly used for observing underwater macrofauna and habitat. Most video techniques that do not need the presence of a diver use baited remote systems. In this paper, we present an original video technique which relies on a remote unbaited rotating remote system including a high definition camera. The system is set on the sea floor to record images. These are then analysed at the office to quantify biotic and abiotic sea bottom cover, and to identify and count fish species and other species like marine turtles. The technique was extensively tested in a highly diversified coral reef ecosystem in the South Lagoon of New Caledonia, based on a protocol covering both protected and unprotected areas in major lagoon habitats. The technique enabled to detect and identify a large number of species, and in particular fished species, which were not disturbed by the system. Habitat could easily be investigated through the images. A large number of observations could be carried out per day at sea. This study showed the strong potential of this non obtrusive technique for observing both macrofauna and habitat. It offers a unique spatial coverage and can be implemented at sea at a reasonable cost by non-expert staff. As such, this technique is particularly interesting for investigating and monitoring coastal biodiversity in the light of current conservation challenges and increasing monitoring needs.},

abstract = {The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.},

Total soil P was a better predictor of wood production rates than any of the fractionated organic- or inorganic-P pools. This suggests that it is not only the immediately available P forms, but probably the entire soil phosphorus pool that is interacting with forest growth on longer timescales. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nA role for soil potassium in modulating Amazon forest dynamics through its effects on stand-level wood density was also detected. Taking this into account, otherwise enigmatic variations in stand-level biomass across the Basin were then accounted for through the interacting effects of soil physical and chemical properties with climate. A hypothesis of self-maintaining forest dynamic feedback mechanisms initiated by edaphic conditions is proposed. It is further suggested that this is a major factor determining endogenous disturbance levels, species composition, and forest productivity across the Amazon Basin.},

abstract = {In order to simulate the long-term (months-years) median Escherichia coli distributions and variations in the tidal Scheldt River and Estuary, a dedicated module was developed for the Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model (SLIM, www.climate.be/slim). The resulting model (SLIM-EC2) presents two specific and new features compared to the older SLIM-EC model version. The first is that the E. coli concentrations in the river are split in three fractions: the free E. coli in the water column, the ones attached to suspended solids and those present in the bottom sediments, each with their own transport, decay and settling-resuspension dynamics. The bacteria attached to particles can settle and survive on the bottom, where they can be brought back in the water column during resuspension events. The second new feature of the model is that it is coupled to the catchment model SENEQUE-EC, which thus provides upstream boundary conditions to SLIM-EC2. The result is an integrated and multi-scale model of the whole Scheldt drainage network from its source down to the Belgian/Dutch coastal zone. This new model reproduces the long-term median E. coli concentration along the Scheldt River and Estuary. An extensive sensitivity study is performed demonstrating the relative robustness of the model with respect to the chosen parameterisations. In addition to reproducing the observed E. coli concentrations in 2007-2008 at various stations, two extreme wastewater management scenarios were considered. Overall, there is no doubt that the Scheldt Estuary acts as a cleaning filter of faecal contamination originating from large Belgian cities. As a result, at the mouth of the Scheldt Estuary E. coli concentration is negligible in all investigated conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the ‘folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

abstract = {Monitoring of intertidal reefs is traditionally undertaken by on-ground survey methods which have assisted in understanding these complex habitats; however, often only a small spatial footprint of the reef is observed. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide new opportunities for monitoring broad scale coastal ecosystems through the ability to capture centimetre resolution imagery and topographic data not possible with conventional approaches. This study compares UAV remote sensing of intertidal reefs to traditional on-ground monitoring surveys, and investigates the role of UAV derived geomorphological variables in explaining observed intertidal algal and invertebrate assemblages. A multirotor UAV was used to capture {\textless}1 cm resolution data from intertidal reefs, with on-ground quadrat surveys of intertidal biotic data for comparison. UAV surveys provided reliable estimates of dominant canopy-forming algae, however, understorey species were obscured and often underestimated. UAV derived geomorphic variables showed elevation and distance to seaward reef edge explained 19.7{\%} and 15.9{\%} of the variation in algal and invertebrate assemblage structure respectively. The findings of this study demonstrate benefits of low-cost UAVs for intertidal monitoring through rapid data collection, full coverage census, identification of dominant canopy habitat and generation of geomorphic derivatives for explaining biological variation.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models' assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species. 2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation. 3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario. 4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MaxEnt. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings. 5.Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made accessible in MaxEnt provide a forward step.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of tree species on the natural 15N abundance in forest stands under elevated ambient N deposition. Methods We analysed $\delta$15N in litter, the forest floor and three mineral soil horizons along with ecosystem N status variables at six sites planted three decades ago with five European broadleaved tree species and Norway spruce. Results Litter $\delta$15N and 15N enrichment factor ($\delta$15Nlitter–$\delta$15Nsoil) were positively correlated with N status based on soil and litter N pools, nitrification, subsoil nitrate concentration and forest growth. Tree species differences were also significant for these N variables and for the litter $\delta$15N and enrichment factor. Litter from ash and sycamore maple with high N status and low fungal mycelia activity was enriched in 15N (+0.9 delta units) relative to other tree species (European beech, pedunculate oak, lime and Norway spruce) even though the latter species leached more nitrate. Conclusions The $\delta$15N pattern reflected tree species related traits affecting the N cycling as well as site fertility and former land use, and possibly differences in N leaching. The tree species $\delta$15N patterns reflected fractionation caused by uptake of N through mycorrhiza rather than due to nitrate leaching or other N transformation processes.},

We tested the effects of soil and litter nutrient stoichiometry on the invertebrate litter fauna of a Costa Rican tropical rain forest. Animal densities were estimated from 15 sites across a phosphorus gradient. The density of the invertebrate litter fauna varied considerably, and was strongly tied to soil and litter phosphorus concentrations. An increase in phosphorus concentrations corresponded with an equally proportionate increase in animal densities. Natural variation in nutrient levels can thus serve as a predictor of density in a highly diverse tropical animal community},

abstract = {We defined a standardized method for discriminating candidate silver eels that may undergo catadromous migration in the following season from the sedentary fraction of a population. A combination of two qualitative criteria (state of differentia- tion of the lateral line and colour contrast) and one quantitative criterion (Ocular Index OI) was used to determine the development toward silvering. In the non-migratory phase, we found a gradient of the three criteria between yellow (0 criterion), presilver (1 to 2 criteria) and silver (3 criteria) eels. In the migrant phase, silver eels had ended their metamorphosis process and were characterized at the same time by the presence of the 3 silvering criteria. A mark-recapture survey using PIT-tags provided evidence that only identified silver eels (3 silvering criteria present) in the catchment actually emigrated the following season. Moreover, the use of a single criterion of silvering among the three generated large variation in the estimated proportion of candidates for emigration which varied between –22{\%} and +63 {\%}. Such a result confirmed that a multicriteria approach is needed to characterize in a standard way the potentially mi- grating silver eel.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Quantifying ecosystem carbon stocks is vital for understanding the relationship between changes in land use and carbon dioxide emissions. Here, we estimate carbon stocks in an area of miombo woodland in Mozambique, by identifying the major carbon stocks and their variability. Data on the biomass of tree stems and roots, saplings, and soil carbon stocks are reported and compared with other savannas systems around the globe. A new allometric relationship between stem diameter and tree stem and root biomass is presented, based on the destructive harvest of 29 trees. These allometrics are combined with an inventory of 12,733 trees on 58 plots over an area of 27-{\'{a}}ha. Ecosystem carbon stocks totaled 110-{\'{a}}tC/ha, with 76-{\'{a}}tC/ha in the soil carbon pool (to 50-{\'{a}}cm depth), 21.2-{\'{a}}tC/ha in tree stem biomass, 8.5-{\'{a}}tC/ha in tree coarse root biomass, and 3.6-{\'{a}}tC/ha in total sapling biomass. Plot-level tree root:stem (R:S) ratio varied from 0.27 to 0.58, with a mean of 0.42, slightly higher than the mean reported for 18 other savanna sites with comparable aboveground biomass (R:S=0.35). Tree biomass (stem+root) ranged from 3.1 to 86.5-{\'{a}}tC/ha, but the mean (32.1-{\'{a}}tC/ha) was well constrained (95{\%} CI 28G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}36.6). In contrast, soil carbon stocks were almost uniformly distributed and varied from 32 to 133-{\'{a}}tC/ha. Soil carbon stocks are thus the major uncertainty in the carbon storage of these woodlands. Soil texture explained 53 percent of the variation in soil carbon content, but only 13 percent of the variation in woody carbon stocks. The history of disturbance (fire, elephants, logging/charcoal production, and shifting cultivation) is likely to decouple changes in woody carbon stocks from soil carbon stocks, mediated by treeG{\c{C}}{\^{o}}grass interactions.

The purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap between the 1986 and 2007 symposia, noting some of the scientific advances, but also the fact that many populations of diadromous fishes have declined. These problems are reflected in the focus of the present symposium on conservation and socioeconomic aspects, as well as life history, diversity, and migration patterns. The enormity of the changes in the environment, both natural and anthropogenic, poses tremendous challenges for diadromous fishes and further emphasizes the need for linkage between research and conservation, using all the tools at the disposal of modern science and the development of new ones.},

abstract = {The relationship between poor water quality and migration opportunities for fish remains poorly documented, although it is an essential research step in implementing EU water legislation. In this paper, we model the environmental constraints that control the movements of anadromous and catadromous fish populations that migrate through the tidal watershed of River Scheldt, a heavily impacted river basin in Western Europe. Local populations of sturgeon, sea lamprey, sea trout, Atlantic salmon, houting and allis shad were essentially extirpated around 1900. For remaining populations (flounder, three-spined stickleback, twaite shad, thinlip mullet, European eel and European smelt), a data driven logistic model was parameterized. The presence or absence of fish species in samples taken between 1995 and 2004 was modelled as a function of temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, river flow and season. Probabilities to catch individuals from all diadromous species but three-spined stickleback increased as a function of the interaction between temperature and dissolved oxygen. The hypoxic zone situated in the freshwater tidal part of the estuary was an effective barrier for upstream migrating anadromous spawners since it blocked the entrance to historical spawning sites upstream. Similarly, habitat availability for catadromous fish was greatly reduced and restricted to lower brackish water parts of the estuary. The model was applied to infer preliminary dissolved oxygen criteria for diadromous fish, to make qualitative predictions about future changes in fish distribution given anticipated changes in water quality and to suggest necessary measures with respect to watershed management. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hypoxia is a critical water quality concern for living resources in Chesapeake Bay and other water bodies worldwide. Causes of hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay are related to both biogeochemical and physical processes, with nutrient loadings and stratification being two commonly cited factors. Within this context, unanswered questions remain about the relationship of oxygen conditions to changes in nutrient loads.    The motivation for this research was to evaluate long-term trends in hypoxic volume (the volume of water with low oxygen) principally by developing improved access and workflows for considering bay data and by creating and applying improved tools for spatial interpolation. The approach was two-fold: (1) develop and test alternative spatial interpolation techniques for water quality data as needed to compute hypoxic volume; and (2) use these methods to investigate hypotheses about hypoxia trends and changes in bay stratification.    The interpolation methods developed in this work included kriging-based methods that (1) incorporate process-based model output, (2) account for vertical anisotropy in the bay, and (3) use alternative measures of similarity (rather than Euclidean distance) – i.e., “water distance” (the distance between points over water) and “travel time” (the time for water to flow between locations). These interpolation methods were used to examine the long-term trends in hypoxic volume, and results were compared to stratification and nutrient-load trends.    A major new finding was that there are clear intra-summer differences in the long-term trends of hypoxic volume in Chesapeake Bay. In particular, there has been an increase in early summer hypoxic volume in recent decades and a slight decrease in late summer hypoxia. The increase in early summer hypoxia correlates with an increase in early summer bay stratification strength and the decrease in late summer hypoxia correlates with trends of decreasing total nitrogen loading to the bay. More generally, the research showed that inclusion of more location-and process-specific information into water quality interpolations can improve interpolation performance in shallow waters, lateral transects, and areas with complex flow. Overall, this research revealed important trends in Chesapeake Bay water quality and resulted in new tools for data analysis in physically dynamic and complex water bodies.},

abstract = {Tropical reforestation (TR) has been highlighted as an important intervention for climate change mitigation because of its carbon storage potential. TR can also play other frequently overlooked, but significant, roles in helping society and ecosystems adapt to climate variability and change. For example, reforestation can ameliorate climate-associated impacts of altered hydrological cycles in watersheds, protect coastal areas from increased storms, and provide habitat to reduce the probability of species' extinctions under a changing climate. Consequently, reforestation should be managed with both adaptation and mitigation objectives in mind, so as to maximize synergies among these diverse roles, and to avoid trade-offs in which the achievement of one goal is detrimental to another. Management of increased forest cover must also incorporate measures for reducing the direct and indirect impacts of changing climate on reforestation itself. Here we advocate a focus on "climate-smart reforestation," defined as reforesting for climate change mitigation and adaptation, while ensuring that the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on reforestation are anticipated and minimized.},

Long-term monitoring of plots in mature humid tropical forests concentrated in South America revealed that biomass gain by tree growth exceeded losses from tree death in 38 of 50 Neotropical sites. These forest plots have accumulated 0.71 ton, plus or minus 0.34 ton, of carbon per hectare per year in recent decades.

abstract = {Spawning behaviour of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) was investigated using electronic satellite tags deployed in the western Mediterranean spawning ground, around the Balearic Islands (years 2009-2011). All the fish were tagged underwater and released within schools. In general, the fish tagged in the same year/school displayed common migratory trends. Following extended residency around the Balearic Islands, most tagged tuna crossed the Strait of Gibraltar heading for the North Atlantic. Discrepancies between the migratory tracks reconstructed from this and previous electronic tagging studies suggest that the bluefin tuna Mediterranean population may comprise distinct units exhibiting differing migratory behaviours. The diving behaviour varied between oceanic regions throughout the migratory pathways, the shallowest distribution taking place in the spawning ground and the deepest at the Strait of Gibraltar. A unique diving pattern was found on the majority of nights while the fish stayed at the spawning ground; it consisted of frequent and brief oscillatory movements up and down through the mixed layer, resulting in thermal profiles characterized by oscillations about the thermocline. Such a pattern is believed to reflect recent courtship and spawning activity. Reproductive parameters inferred from the analysis of vertical profiles are consistent with those estimated in previous studies based on biological samples.},

abstract = {Weathering and development of volcanic ash soils show similar patterns in different regions of the world; however, the specific environmental conditions at a given location result in a unique combination of factors and processes governing soil formation. This research was conducted to study pedogenesis on volcanic slopes in the inter-Andean valley of northern Ecuador. Twelve pedons representing different pedogenic environments were sampled at elevations between 2410 and 4050 m above sea level (asl). In pedons above 3200 m asl, allophane and Al-humus complexes dominate the colloidal fraction, the topsoils are high in organic matter, and the soils classify as Andisols with melanic epipedons. In pedons below 2700 m asl, halloysite is the predominant colloidal constituent, the topsoils contain {\textless}1{\%} organic C, and the soils are Inceptisols and Entisols. The pedons at intermediate elevations mark a transition zone, in which allophane and halloysite coexist and the soils generally classify as Andisols with umbric epipedons. This general altitudinal pattern was found to be altered in unstable landscape positions, where andic soil properties have been removed along with the erosion of topsoil material. Virtually the same altitudinal weathering sequence was observed in the 3000-yr-old soils and in buried paleosols, which are considered to be older than 40 000 years. Thus, different time of pedogenesis has not caused marked differences in the composition of the colloidal fraction. Climate is considered the overriding factor responsible for the observed altitudinal differences in soil development by affecting leaching regime and organic matter decomposition.},

abstract = {Resilience-based management aims to promote or protect processes and species that underpin an ecosystem's capacity to withstand and recover from disturbance. The management of ecological processes is a developing field that requires reliable indicators that can be monitored over time. Herbivory is a key ecological process on coral reefs, and pooling herbivorous fishes into functional groups based on their feeding mode is increasingly used as it may quantify herbivory in ways that indicate resilience. Here we evaluate whether the biomass estimates of these herbivore functional groups are good predictors of reef benthic assemblages, using data from 240 sites from five island groups in American Samoa. Using an information theoretic approach, we assembled a candidate set of linear and nonlinear models to identify the relations between benthic cover and total herbivore and non-herbivore biomass and the biomass of the aforementioned functional groups. For each benthic substrate type considered (encrusting algae, fleshy macroalgae, hard coral and turf algae), the biomass of herbivorous fishes were important explanatory variables in predicting benthic cover, whereas biomass of all fishes combined generally was not. Also, in all four cases, variation in cover was best explained by the biomass of specific functional groups rather than by all herbivores combined. Specifically: 1) macroalgal and turf algal cover decreased with increasing biomass of 'grazers/detritivores'; and 2) cover of encrusting algae increased with increasing biomass of 'grazers/detritivores' and browsers. Furthermore, hard coral cover increased with the biomass of large excavators/bio-eroders (made up of large-bodied parrotfishes). Collectively, these findings emphasize the link between herbivorous fishes and the benthic community and demonstrate support for the use of functional groups of herbivores as indicators for resilience-based monitoring.},

abstract = {Litter production from above-ground (leaves, twigs, fruits, flowers) and below-ground (roots) plant organs is an important component of the cycling of carbon and nutrients in forests. Tropical montane forests possess comparatively large quantities of fine-root biomass, suggesting that litter production by dying fine rootsmay represent a major component of total litter production. In a comparative study in three tropical montane forests of southern Ecuador at 1890, 2380 and 3060melevation, we measured leaf-fall by litter trapping and fine-root litter production by sequential soil coring and fine-root biomass and necromass analysis for about 1ywith the objectives (1) to quantify annual above- and below-ground litter production, and (2) to investigate elevational differences in litter production. Leaf littermass decreased to less than a third (862 to 263gm−2 y−1) with increasing elevation (1890mto 3060m), whereas fine-root litter production increased by a factor of about four (506 to 2084gm−2 y−1). Thus, the ratio of leaf to fine-root litter shifted by an order of magnitude in favour of fine-root litter production between 1890 to 3060m. Fine-root litter production was not synchronized with leaf litterfall and was seasonal only at 3060m with mortality peaks in the drier and the wetter periods.We conclude that dying fine roots represent a very important fraction of total litterfall intropicalmontane forests that can exceed the quantity of leaf litter. At3060m, the largest part of the organic material on top of the soil must originate from dying fine roots but not from fallen leaves.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to explain and predict species ranges and environmental niches. They are most commonly constructed by inferring species' occurrence–environment relationships using statistical and machine-learning methods. The variety of methods that can be used to construct SDMs (e.g. generalized linear/additive models, tree-based models, maximum entropy, etc.), and the variety of ways that such models can be implemented, permits substantial flexibility in SDM complexity. Building models with an appropriate amount of complexity for the study objectives is critical for robust inference. We characterize complexity as the shape of the inferred occurrence–environment relationships and the number of parameters used to describe them, and search for insights into whether additional complexity is informative or superfluous. By building ‘under fit' models, having insufficient flexibility to describe observed occurrence–environment relationships, we risk misunderstanding the factors shaping species distributions. By building ‘over fit' models, with excessive flexibility, we risk inadvertently ascribing pattern to noise or building opaque models. However, model selection can be challenging, especially when comparing models constructed under different modeling approaches. Here we argue for a more pragmatic approach: researchers should constrain the complexity of their models based on study objective, attributes of the data, and an understanding of how these interact with the underlying biological processes. We discuss guidelines for balancing under fitting with over fitting and consequently how complexity affects decisions made during model building. Although some generalities are possible, our discussion reflects differences in opinions that favor simpler versus more complex models. We conclude that combining insights from both simple and complex SDM building approaches best advances our knowledge of current and future species ranges.},

For aquatic species, field sampling can require extensive effort and may be unreliable in terms of determining the presence or absence of a target species, especially when the target species is rare. For this study we used eDNA to try to detect Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi) and Gulf Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) presence in the Mobile River Basin of Alabama. These two sturgeon species make ideal model organisms for examination of this technique in the detection of rare species, as the Alabama Sturgeon is critically endangered and the Gulf Sturgeon is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. In spite of the critical need for information on these species, riverine sampling is expensive and produces low detection. Results using eDNA have revealed temporally logical, positive detections of Alabama and Gulf sturgeon throughout the Mobile River Basin sites included in this study. Successful detection of these species could reveal vital information such as understanding of habitat use for management purposes as well as identify specific localities for field sampling.

abstract = {Above-ground dry biomass of living trees including palms was estimated in 65 1 ha plots spanning a 1000 km2 landscape in central Amazonia. The study area was located on heavily weathered, nutrient-poor soils that are widespread in the Amazon region. Biomass values were derived by measuring the diameter-at-breast-height (DBH) of all ≥ 10 cm trees in each plot, then using an allometric equation and correction factor for small trees to estimate total tree biomass. Detailed information on soil texture, organic carbon, available water capacity, pH, macro- and micro-nutrients, and trace elements was collected from soil surface samples (0-20 cm) in each plot, while slope was measured with a clinometer. Biomass estimates varies more than two-fold, from 231 to 492 metric tons ha-1, with a mean of 356 ± 47 tons ha-1. Simple correlations with stringent (p {\textless} 0.006) Bonferroni corrections suggested that biomass was positively associated with total N, total exchangeable bases, K+, Mg2+, clay, and organic C in soils, and negatively associated with Zn+, aluminum saturation, and sand. An ordination analysis revealed one major and several minor soil gradients in the study area, with the main gradient discriminating sites with varying proportions of clay (with clayey soils having higher concentrations of total N, organic C, most cations, and lower aluminum saturation and less sand). A multiple regression analysis revealed that the major clay-nutrient gradient was the only significant predictor, with the model explaining 32.3{\%} of the total variation in biomass. Results of the analysis suggest that soil-fertility parameters can account for a third or more of the variation in above-ground biomass in Amazonian terra-time forests. We suggest that, because the conversion of forest to pasture tends to reduce the nitrogen, clay, organic carbon, and nutrient contents of soils, forests that regenerate on formerly cleared lands may have lower biomass than the original forest, especially in areas with low soil fertility.},

abstract = {Leatherback turtles are renowned for their trans-oceanic migrations. However, despite numerous movement studies, the precise drivers of movement patterns in leatherbacks remain elusive. Many previous studies of leatherback turtles as well as other diving marine predators have analyzed surface movement patterns using only surface covariates. Since turtles and other marine predators spend the vast majority of their time diving under water, an analysis of movement patterns at depth should yield insight into what drives their movements. We analyzed the movement paths of 15 post-nesting adult female Pacific leatherback turtles, which were caught and tagged on three nesting beaches in Mexico. The temporal length of the tracks ranged from 32 to 436 days, and the spatial distance covered ranged from 1,532 km to 13,097 km. We analyzed these tracks using a movement model designed to yield inference on the parameters driving movement. Because the telemetry data included diving depths, we extended an earlier version of the model that examined surface only movements, and here analyze movements in 3-dimensions. We tested the effect of dynamic environmental covariates from a coupled biophysical oceanographic model on patch choice in diving leatherback turtles, and compared the effects of parameters measured at the surface and at depth. The covariates included distance to future patch, temperature, salinity, meridional current velocity (current in the north–south direction), zonal current velocity (current in the east–west direction), phytoplankton density, diatom density, micro-plankton density, and meso-zooplankton density. We found significant, i.e. non-zero, correlation between movement and the parameters for oceanic covariates in 8 of the tracks. Of particular note, for one turtle we observed a lack of correlation between movements and a modeled index of zooplankton at the surface, but a significant correlation between movements and zooplankton at depth. Two of the turtles express a preference for patches at depth with elevated diatoms, and 2 turtles prefer patches with higher mezozooplankton values at depth. In contrast, 4 turtles expressed a preference for elevated zooplankton patches at the surface, but not at depth. We suggest that our understanding of a marine predator's response to the environment may change significantly depending upon the analytical frame of reference, i.e. whether relationships are examined at the surface, at depth, or at different temporal resolutions. Lastly, we tested the effects of accounting for ocean currents on the movement patterns and found that for 13 of the 15 turtles, the parameter governing distance to the next patch decreased. Our results suggest that relationships derived from the analysis of surface tracks may not entirely explain movement patterns of this highly migratory species. Accounting for choices in the water column has shown that for certain individual turtles, what appears to be favourable habitat at depth is quantitatively different from that at the surface. This has implications for the analysis of the movements and diving behaviour of any top marine predator. The leatherback turtle is a deep diving reptile, and it is important to understand the subsurface variables that influence their movements if we are to precisely map the spatial dimensions of favorable leatherback habitat. These results present a new view into the drivers of diving patterns in turtles, and in particular represent a way of analyzing movements at depth that can be extended to other diving species.},

We adopt both 2-D and 3-D shape functions from finite element methods for the spatio-temporal interpolation of 2-D spatial and 1-D temporal data sets. We also develop new 4-D shape functions and use them for the spatio-temporal interpolation of 3-D spatial and 1-D temporal data sets. Using an actual real estate data set with house prices, we compare these methods with other spatio-temporal interpolation methods based on inverse distance weighting and kriging. The comparison criteria include interpolation accuracy, error-proneness to time aggregation, invariance to scaling on the coordinate axes, and the type of constraints used in the representation of the interpolated data. Our experimental results show that the extension method based on shape functions is the most accurate and the overall best spatio-temporal interpolation method. New color rendering algorithms are also developed for the visualization of time slices of the interpolated spatio-temporal data. We show some visualization results of the real estate data set including the vertical profile of house prices. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are empirical models relating species occurrence to environmental variables based on statistical or other response surfaces. Species distribution modeling can be used as a tool to solve many theoretical and applied ecological and environmental problems, which include testing biogeographical, ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, assessing species invasion and climate change impact, and supporting conservation planning and reserve selection. The utility of SDM in real world applications requires the knowledge of the model's accuracy. The accuracy of a model includes two aspects: discrimination capacity and reliability. The former is the power of the model to differentiate presences from absences; and the latter refers to the capability of the predicted probabilities to reflect the observed proportion of sites occupied by the subject species. Similar methodology has been used for model accuracy assessment in different fields, including medical diagnostic test, weather forecasting and machine learning, etc. Some accuracy measures are used in all fields, e.g. the overall accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; while the use of other measures is largely restricted to specific fields, e.g. F-measure is mainly used in machine learning field, or is referred to by different names in different fields, e.g. “true skill statistic” is used in atmospheric science and it is called “Youden's J” in medical diagnostic field. In this paper we review those accuracy measures typically used in ecology. Generally, the measures can be divided into two groups: threshold-dependent and thresholdindependent. Measures in the first group are used for binary predictions, and those in the second group are used for continuous predictions. Continuous predictions may be transformed to binary ones if a specific threshold is employed. In such cases, the threshold-dependent accuracy measures can also be used. The threshold-dependent indices used in or introduced to SDM field include overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, odds ratio, true skill statistic, F-measure, Cohen's kappa, and normalized mutual information (NMI). However, since NMI only measures the agreement between two patterns, it cannot differentiate the worse-than-random models from the better-thanrandom models, which reduces its utility as an accuracy measure. The threshold-independent indices used in or introduced to the SDM field include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Gini index, and point biserial correlation coefficient. The proportion of explained deviance D2 and its adjusted form have been also introduced into SDM field. But this adjusted metric has no theoretical foundation in the context of generalized linear modeling. Therefore, we provide another adjusted form, which was proposed by H. V. Houwelingen based on the asymptotic $\chi$ 2 distribution of the log-likelihood statistics. Its superiority over other related measures has been found through previous simulation studies. We also provide another analogous measure, the coefficient of determination R2 , which has had a long history in weather forecast verification and was also recommended for use in medical diagnosis. Though these measures D2 and R2 are routinely used to evaluate generalized linear models (GLMs), we argue that nothing prevents them from being applied to other GLM-like models. In SDM accuracy assessment, discrimination capacity is often considered, but model reliability is frequently ignored. The primary reason for this is that no reliability measure has been introduced into the ecological literature. To meet this need we also suggest that root mean square error be used as a reliability measure. Its squared form, mean square error, has been used in meteorology for a long time, and is called Brier's score. We also discuss the effect of prevalence dependence of accuracy measures and the precision of accuracy estimates.},

abstract = {To make a macrofaunal (crustacean) habitat potential map, the spatial distribution of ecological variables in the Hwangdo tidal flat, Korea, was explored. Spatial variables were mapped using remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS) combined with field observations. A frequency ratio (FR) and logistic regression (LR) model were employed to map the macrofauna potential area for the Ilyoplax dentimerosa, a crustacean species. Spatial variables affecting the tidal macrofauna distribution were selected based on abundance and biomass and used within a spatial database derived from remotely sensed data of various types of sensors. The spatial variables included the intertidal digital elevation model (DEM), slope, distance from a tidal channel, tidal channel density, surface sediment facies, spectral reflectance of the near infrared (NIR) bands and the tidal exposure duration. The relation between the I. dentimerosa and each spatial variable was calculated using the FR and LR. The species was randomly divided into a training set (70{\%}) to analyse habitat potential using FR and LR and a test set (30{\%}) to validate the predicted habitat potential map. The relations were overlaid to produce a habitat potential map with the species potential index (SPI) value for each pixel. The potential habitat maps were compared with the surveyed habitat locations such as validation data set. The comparison results showed that the LR model (accuracy is 85.28{\%}) is better in prediction than the FR (accuracy is 78.96{\%}) model. The performance of models gave satisfactory accuracies. The LR provides the quantitative influence of variables on a potential habitat of species; otherwise, the FR shows the quantitative influence of a class in each variable. The combination of a GIS-based frequency ratio and logistic regression models and remote sensing with field observations is an effective method to determine locations favorable for macrofaunal species occurrences in a tidal flat. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recent global warming is acting across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems to favor species adapted to warmer conditions and/or reduce the abundance of cold-adapted organisms (i.e., "thermophilization" of communities). Lack of community responses to increased temperature, however, has also been reported for several taxa and regions, suggesting that "climatic lags" may be frequent. Here we show that microclimatic effects brought about by forest canopy closure can buffer biotic responses to macroclimate warming, thus explaining an apparent climatic lag. Using data from 1,409 vegetation plots in European and North American temperate forests, each surveyed at least twice over an interval of 12-67 y, we document significant thermophilization of ground-layer plant communities. These changes reflect concurrent declines in species adapted to cooler conditions and increases in species adapted to warmer conditions. However, thermophilization, particularly the increase of warm-adapted species, is attenuated in forests whose canopies have become denser, probably reflecting cooler growing-season ground temperatures via increased shading. As standing stocks of trees have increased in many temperate forests in recent decades, local microclimatic effects may commonly be moderating the impacts of macroclimate warming on forest understories. Conversely, increases in harvesting woody biomass--e.g., for bioenergy--may open forest canopies and accelerate thermophilization of temperate forest biodiversity.},

Soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, total phosphorous (P) and AP concentration were measured for three contrasting forest types in southern China: Masson pine forest (MPF), coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest (CBMF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (MEBF). A pot experiment with N addition was conducted to confirm the dominant factor to affect on soil AP concentration. The results showed that mean soil total N concentration in 0-10 cm soil layer was 440 ± 50 for MPF, 840 ± 80 for CBMF and 1020 ± 50 mg kg(-1) for MEBF, respectively. The mean soil AP concentration in 0-10 cm soil layer was 2.67 ± 0.87 for MPF, 2.65 ± 0.58 for CBMF, 4.10 ± 0.29 mg kg(-1) for MEBF, respectively. The soil total N concentration could explain about 70{\%} of the variations in soil AP concentration in the top 20 cm soil layers in the three forest types. A pot experiment with N addition also showed an increase of AP concentration from 2.56 to 5.63 mg kg(-1), when N addition increased from 5 g to 17 g NH4NO3. Our results therefore suggested that N addition significantly increased soil AP concentration, which might be beneficial for stabilizing the net primary production of subtropical forests that were limited by soil AP. This finding may provide a theory basis for tropical and subtropical forests management.},

abstract = {This article shows how geostatistics can be used to reduce distributed physically based model (DPBM) uncertainties when assessing nitrate concentrations along a 250-km stretch of the Seine River. First of all, co-kriging is used to build a set of boundary conditions (BCs) (inlet concentrations from major tributary rivers) consistent with validation data. It partially addresses the issues of errors in data used as model input and errors in data to be compared with model outputs. Then the analysis of temporal variograms (simple variograms of observed and simulated concentrations, and their cross-variogram) reveals a clear mismatch between simulated and observed values that was not detected by classical objective functions [root mean squared error (RMSE), etc.]. Variograms appear to include three components representing three different time scales: sub-weekly, monthly and annual scales. Mismatches between simulated and observed values are analysed as (i) wrong quantification of inputs to the river (especially during the rainy period: combined sewer overflow (CSO), waste water treatment plant (WWTP) and tributary contributions to the nitrate fluxes in the Seine River) and (ii) wrong description of physical processes within the river. Finally, the modelling of simple and cross-variograms appears to be a sensitive analysis tool which can be used to describe and reduce modelling uncertainties.

The algorithm was established empirically using in situ data of the water-leaving reflectance obtained over the tidal cycle during different seasons and different years. Different bands and band combinations were tested. Strong correlations were obtained for exponential relationships between band ratios and SPM concentration. The best performing relationships are validated using airborne hyperspectral data acquired in June 2005 and October 2007 at different moments in the tidal cycle. A band ratio algorithm (710 nm/596 nm) was successfully applied to a hyperspectral AHS image of the Scheldt River to obtain an SPM concentration map.},

abstract = {Species distribution modelling has been widely applied in order to assess the potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Many methodological decisions, taken during the modelling process and forecasts, may, however, lead to a large variability in the assessment of future impacts. Using measures of species range change and turnover, the potential impacts of climate change on French stream fish species and assemblages were evaluated. Our main focus was to quantify the uncertainty in the projections of these impacts arising from four sources of uncertainty: initial datasets (Data), statistical methods [species distribution models (SDM)], general circulation models (GCM), and gas emission scenarios (GES). Several modalities of the aforementioned uncertainty sources were combined in an ensemble forecasting framework resulting in 8400 different projections. The variance explained by each source was then extracted from this whole ensemble of projections. Overall, SDM contributed to the largest variation in projections, followed by GCM, whose contribution increased over time equalling almost the proportion of variance explained by SDM in 2080. Data and GES had little influence on the variability in projections. Future projections of range change were more consistent for species with a large geographical extent (i.e., distribution along latitudinal or stream gradients) or with restricted environmental requirements (i.e., small thermal or elevation ranges). Variability in projections of turnover was spatially structured at the scale of France, indicating that certain particular geographical areas should be considered with care when projecting the potential impacts of climate change. The results of this study, therefore, emphasized that particular attention should be paid to the use of predictions ensembles resulting from the application of several statistical methods and climate models. Moreover, forecasted impacts of climate change should always be provided with an assessment of their uncertainty, so that management and conservation decisions can be taken in the full knowledge of their reliability},

abstract = {An advanced data assimilation system, the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF), has been interfaced with a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) implementation on the Chesapeake Bay (ChesROMS) as a first step toward a reanalysis and improved forecast system for the Chesapeake Bay. The LETKF is among the most advanced data assimilation methods and is very effective for large, nonlinear dynamical systems with sparse data coverage. Errors in the Chesapeake Bay system are due more to errors in forcing than errors in initial conditions. To account for forcing errors, a forcing ensemble is used to drive the ensemble states for the year 2003. In the observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) using the ChesROMS-LETKF system presented here, the filter converges quickly and greatly reduces the analysis and subsequent forecast errors in the temperature, salinity, and current fields in the presence of errors in wind forcing. Most of the improvement in temperature and currents comes from satellite sea surface temperature (SST), while in situ salinity profiles provide improvement to salinity. Corrections permeate through all vertical levels and some correction to stratification is seen in the analysis. In the upper Bay where the nature-run summer stratification is 20.2 salinity units per meter, stratification is improved from 20.01 per meter in the unassimilated model to 20.16 per meter in the assimilation. Improvements are seen in other parts of the Bay as well. The results from the OSSEs are promising for assimilating real data in the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Ecosystem rather than species management has become an explicit part of policies that feature in international treaties and national legislation. Many of the tools that will be needed to fulfil the requirements of these policies are still in an early stage of development. One such tool is trophic ecosystem modelling. These models have been put forward to aid system-level understanding and provide insight into the potential impacts of human activities. Despite this, there are many gaps in knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, little is known about the effect of the level of detail in a model on its performance. There has been some consideration of the effects of model formulation, as well as the effects of the physical, biological and chemical scope of multispecies and ecosystem models on their performance. A review of existing research indicates that there is a humped relationship between model detail and performance for these models, and that there are some guiding principles to consider during model development. This review gives some insight into which model structures and assumptions are likely to aid understanding and management, and which may be unnecessary. Further, it provides some understanding of whether some models can capture properties of real systems that other models cannot. The main recommendation is that the use of a single {\OE}ultimate¹ ecosystem model is ill-advised, while the comparative and confirmatory use of multiple {\OE}minimum-realistic¹ models is strongly recommended.},

abstract = {Geostatistical techniques have gained widespread use in ecology and environmental science. Variograms are commonly used to describe and examine spatial autocorrelation, and kriging has become the method of choice for interpolating spatially-autocorrelated variables. To date, most applications of geostatistics have defined the separation between sample points using simple Euclidean distance. In heterogeneous environments, however, certain landscape features may act as absolute or semi-permeable barriers. This effective separation may be more accurately described by a measure of distance that accounts for the presence of barriers. Here we present an approach to geostatistics based on a lowest-cost path (LCP) function, in which the cost of a path is a function of both the distance and the type of terrain crossed. The modified technique is applied to 13 years of survey data on blue crab abundance in Chesapeake Bay. Use of this landscape-based distance metric significantly changed estimates of all three variogram parameters. In this case study, although local differences in kriging predictions were apparent, the use of the landscape-based distance metric did not result in consistent improvements in kriging accuracy.},

abstract = {The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) population has decreased sharply over the past few decades owing to a combination of many factors. To determine the impact of hydropower and fisheries during the downstrearn migration of silver eel in the River Meuse, telemetry experiments were performed during the years 2002-2006, using 18 detection stations (NedapTrail-System (R)) in the river and two at the entrance to the hydropower turbines. Recaptures in fisheries were used to assess fisheries mortality. in all, 300 silver eels were surgically implanted with Nedap-transponders. For each stretch between subsequent stations, mortality rates were assessed and related to the different factors. However, to determine the overall effect on the escapement of silver eels from the River Meuse, insight into the distribution of silver eels in the entire catchment of the River Meuse is required. At two locations, mark-recapture experiments in 2002 revealed that the estimated number of migrating silver eels increased strongly in a downstream direction, suggesting that a large proportion of silver eels start their migration from the downstream stretches and tributaries of the River Meuse. Approaches and monitoring requirements that can be used to determine the impact on silver eel populations in a river basin are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Baited underwater video techniques are increasingly being utilised for assessing and monitoring demersal fishes because they are: 1) non extractive, 2) can be used to sample across multiple habitats and depths, 3) are cost effective, 4) sample a broader range of species than many other techniques, 5) and with greater statistical power. However, an examination of the literature demonstrates that a range of different bait types are being used. The use of different types of bait can create an additional source of variability in sampling programs. Coral reef fish assemblages at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, were sampled using baited remote underwater stereo-video systems. One-hour stereo-video recordings were collected for four different bait treatments (pilchards, cat food, falafel mix and no bait (control)) from sites inside and outside a targeted fishery closure (TFC). In total, 5209 individuals from 132 fish species belonging to 41 families were recorded. There were significant differences in the fish assemblage structure and composition between baited and non-baited treatments (P{\textless}0.001), while no difference was observed with species richness. Samples baited with cat food and pilchards contained similar ingredients and were found to record similar components of the fish assemblage. There were no significant differences in the fish assemblages in areas open or closed to fishing, regardless of the bait used. Investigation of five targeted species indicated that the response to different types of bait was species-specific. For example, the relative abundance of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Pagrus auratus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} was found to increase in areas protected from fishing, but only in samples baited with pilchards and cat food. The results indicate that the use of bait in conjunction with stereo-BRUVs is advantageous. On balance, the use of pilchards as a standardised bait for stereo-BRUVs deployments is justified for use along the mid-west coast of Western Australia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods have recently been combined with conventional methods for fisheries stock assessment (e.g. catch-age analysis) to provide a conceptually elegant approach for providing fishery management advice under uncertainty. Uncertainties in the advice provided can be conveyed using posterior probability distributions (or "posteriors") for the potential outcomes of each policy option. Posteriors can be estimated using data (e.g. catch-age data and relative abundance indices) for the fish population of interest and prior probability distributions for population model parameters (e.g. stock-recruit function parameters) based on data from similar fish populations. Despite growing interest, Bayesian methods remain accessible to relatively few. To increase the accessibility of these methods, the conceptual basis for Bayesian statistical estimation is reviewed and set in the context of fisheries stock assessment. The use of Bayesian methods is illustrated by fitting a logistic model to relative abundance indices for Namibian hake (Merlucius capensis and M. paradoxus) and presenting a decision analysis of alternative harvest policy options. Some alternative approaches are outlined for constructing prior and posterior probability distributions and some recent applications in fisheries. Some of the problems that can be encountered while implementing Bayesian methods are also discussed. (C) 1998 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {Fire in tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) is not as rare as once believed. Andean TMCFs sit immediately below highly flammable, high-altitude grasslands (Puna/P{\'{a}}ramo) that suffer from recurrent anthropogenic fire. This treeline is a zone of climatic tension where substantial future warming is likely to force upward tree migrations, while increased fire presence and fire impacts are likely to force it downwards. TMCFs contain large carbon stocks in their peat soils and their loss through fire is a currently unaccounted for regional source of CO2. This study, conducted in the southern Peruvian Andes ({\textgreater}2800m), documents differences in live tree biomass, fine root biomass, fallen and standing dead wood, and soil organic carbon in 4 paired-sample plots (burned versus control) following the severe ground fires that occurred during the 2005 Andean drought. Peat soils contributed the most to biomass burning emissions, with lower values corresponding to an 89{\%} mean stock difference compared to the controls (mean±SE) (54.1±22.3 vs. 5.8±5.3MgCha-1). Contrastingly, carbon stocks from live standing trees differed by a non-significant 37{\%} lower value in the burned plots compared to the controls, largely compensated by vigorous resprouting (45.5±17.4 vs. 69.2±13.4MgCha-1). Both standing dead trees and fallen dead wood were significantly higher in the burned plots with a three-fold difference from the controls: dead Trees 45.2±9.4 vs. 16.4±4.4MgCha-1, and ca. a 2 fold difference for the fallen dead wood: 11.2±5 vs. 6.7±3.2MgCha-1 for the burned plots versus their controls. A preliminary estimate of the regional contribution of biomass burning emissions from Andean TMCFs for the period 2000-2008, resulted in mean carbon emission rates of 1.3TgCyr-1 (max-min: 1.8-0.8TgCyr-1). This value is in the same order of magnitude than South American annual fire emissions (300TgCyr-1) suggesting the need for further research on Andean forest fires. On-going projects on the region are working on the promotion of landowner participation in TMCFs conservation through REDD+ mechanism. The heart of the proposed initiative is reforestation of degraded lands with green fire breaks enriched with economically valuable Andean plant species. The cultivation of these species may contribute to reduce deforestation pressure on the Amazonian cloud forest by providing an alternative income to local communities, at the same time that they prevent the spread of fire into Manu National Park and adjacent community-held forests, protecting forest and reducing CO2 emissions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Studies on the relationship between soil fertility and aboveground biomass in lowland tropical forests have yielded conflicting results, reporting positive, negative and no effect of soil nutrients on aboveground biomass. Here, we quantify the impact of soil variation on the stand structure of mature Bornean forest throughout a lowland watershed (8-196 m a.s.l.) with uniform climate and heterogeneous soils. Categorical and bivariate methods were used to quantify the effects of (1) parent material differing in nutrient content (alluvium {\textgreater} sedimentary {\textgreater} granite) and (2) 27 soil parameters on tree density, size distribution, basal area and aboveground biomass. Trees {\textgreater} or =10 cm (diameter at breast height, dbh) were enumerated in 30 (0.16 ha) plots (sample area = 4.8 ha). Six soil samples (0-20 cm) per plot were analyzed for physiochemical properties. Aboveground biomass was estimated using allometric equations. Across all plots, stem density averaged 521 +/- 13 stems ha(-1), basal area 39.6 +/- 1.4 m(2) ha(-1) and aboveground biomass 518 +/- 28 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- SE). Adjusted forest-wide aboveground biomass to account for apparent overestimation of large tree density (based on 69 0.3-ha transects; sample area = 20.7 ha) was 430 +/- 25 Mg ha(-1). Stand structure did not vary significantly among substrates, but it did show a clear trend toward larger stature on nutrient-rich alluvium, with a higher density and larger maximum size of emergent trees. Across all plots, surface soil phosphorus (P), potassium, magnesium and percentage sand content were significantly related to stem density and/or aboveground biomass (R (Pearson) = 0.368-0.416). In multiple linear regression, extractable P and percentage sand combined explained 31{\%} of the aboveground biomass variance. Regression analyses on size classes showed that the abundance of emergent trees {\textgreater}120 cm dbh was positively related to soil P and exchangeable bases, whereas trees 60-90 cm dbh were negatively related to these factors. Soil fertility thus had a significant effect on both total aboveground biomass and its distribution among size classes.},

abstract = {In many scientific disciplines, straight line, Euclidean distances may not accurately describe proximity relationships among spatial data. However, non-Euclidean distance measures must be used with caution in geostatistical applications. A simple example is provided to demonstrate there are no guarantees that existing covariance and variogram functions remain valid (i.e. positive definite or conditionally negative definite) when used with a non-Euclidean distance measure. There are certain distance measures that when used with existing covariance and variogram functions remain valid, an issue that is explored. The concept of isometric embedding is introduced and linked to the concepts of positive and conditionally negative definiteness to demonstrate classes of valid norm dependent isotropic covariance and variogram functions, results many of which have yet to appear in the mainstream geostatistical literature or application. These classes of functions extend the well known classes by adding a parameter to define the distance norm. In practice, this distance parameter can be set a priori to represent, for example, the Euclidean distance, or kept as a parameter to allow the data to choose the metric. A simulated application of the latter is provided for demonstration. Simulation results are also presented comparing kriged predictions based on Euclidean distance to those based on using a water metric.},

abstract = {We studied the spatial heterogeneity of tree diversity, and of forest structure and productivity in a highly diverse tropical mountain area in southern Ecuador with the aim of understanding the causes of the large variation in these parameters. Two major environmental gradients, elevation and topography, representing a broad range of climatic and edaphic site conditions, were analyzed.Wefound the highest species richness of trees in valleys o2100 m. Valleys showed highest values of basal area, leaf area index and tree basal area increment as well. Tree diversity also increased from ridges to valleys, while canopy openness decreased. Significant relationships existed between tree diversity and soil parameters (pH, total contents of Mg, K, Ca,Nand P), and between diversity and the spatial variability of pH and Ca andMg contents suggesting a dependence of tree diversity on both absolute levels and on the small-scale heterogeneity of soil nutrient availability. Tree diversity and basal area in- crement were positively correlated, partly because both are similarly affected by soil conditions. We conclude that the extraordinarily high tree species richness in the area is primarily caused by three factors: (1) the existence of steep altitudinal and topographic gradients in a rather limited area creating a small-scale mosaic of edaphically different habitats; (2) the intermingling of Amazonian lowland plant species, that reach their upper distribution limits, and of montane forest species; and (3) the geographical position of the study area between the humid eastern Andean slope and the dry interandean forests of South Ecuador.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that P was the nutrient limiting net primary production of a native Metrosideros polymorpha forest on a highly weathered montane tropical soil in Hawaii. A factorial experiment used all combinations of three fertilizer treatments: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and a mix of other essential nutrients (OE), consisting primarily of mineral derived cations and excluding N and P. P addition, but not N or OE, increased leaf area index within 12 months, foliar P concentration measured at 18 months, and stem diameter increment within 18 months. Stem growth at 18 months was even greater when trees fertilized with P also received the OE treatment. N and P additions increased leaf litterfall and N and P in combination further increased litterfall. The sequence of responses suggests that increased available P promoted an increase in photosynthetic area which led to increased wood production. P was the essential element most limiting to primary production on old volcanic soil in contrast to the N limitation found on young volcanic soils.},

abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests are unique among terrestrial ecosystems in that they are strongly linked to regular cycles of cloud formation. We have explored changes in atmospheric parameters from global climate model simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum and for doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (2 x CO2) conditions which are associated with the height of this cloud formation, and hence the occurrence of intact cloud forests. These parameters include vertical profiles of absolute and relative humidity surfaces, as well as the warmth index(1), an empirical proxy of forest type. For the glacial simulations, the warmth index and absolute humidity suggest a downslope shift of cloud forests that agrees with the available palaeodata. For the 2 x CO2 scenario, the relative humidity surface is shifted upwards by hundreds of metres during the winter dry season when these forests typically rely most on the moisture from cloud contact. At the same time, an increase in the warmth index implies increased evapo-transpiration. This combination of reduced cloud contact and increased evapo-transpiration could have serious conservation implications, given that these ecosystems typically harbour a high proportion of endemic species and are often situated on mountain tops or ridge lines.},

Historically, research on elevational diversity gradients has focused almost exclusively on plant and animal taxa. As a result, we do not know whether microbes exhibit elevational gradients in diversity that parallel those observed for macroscopic taxa. This represents a key knowledge gap in ecology, especially given the ubiquity, abundance, and functional importance of microbes. Here we show that, across a montane elevational gradient in eastern Peru, bacteria living in three distinct habitats (organic soil, mineral soil, and leaf surfaces) exhibit no significant elevational gradient in diversity (r2{\textless}0.17, P{\textgreater}0.1 in all cases), in direct contrast to the significant diversity changes observed for plant and animal taxa across the same montane gradient (r2{\textgreater}0.75, P{\textless}0.001 in all cases). This finding suggests that the biogeographical patterns exhibited by bacteria are fundamentally different from those of plants and animals, highlighting the need for the development of more inclusive concepts and theories in biogeography to explain these disparities.},

abstract = {We present Top-kriging, or topological kriging, as a method for estimating streamflow-related variables in ungauged catchments. It takes both the area and the nested nature of catchments into account. The main appeal of the method is that it is a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) adapted for the case of stream networks without any additional assumptions. The concept is built on the work of Sauquet et al. (2000) and extends it in a number of ways. We test the method for the case of the specific 100-year flood for two Austrian regions. The method provides more plausible and, indeed, more accurate estimates than Ordinary Kriging. For the variable of interest, Top-kriging also provides estimates of the uncertainty. On the main stream the estimated uncertainties are smallest and they gradually increase as one moves towards the headwaters. The method as presented here is able to exploit the information contained in short records by accounting for the uncertainty of each gauge. We suggest that Top-kriging can be used for spatially interpolating a range of streamflow-related variables including mean annual discharge, flood characteristics, low flow characteristics, concentrations, turbidity and stream temperature.},

abstract = {In this study we test which environmental factors are influencing the migratory behaviour of seaward migrating silver European eels Anguilla anguilla in a Norwegian river. We test this by transplanting tagged silver eels upriver after catching them in a trap at the outlet of the river. We did this at four fixed dates (fixed day lengths) during 5 years. Over 74{\%} of the variation in time from release to subsequent recapture could be accounted for by variation in time at release, water discharge at release, and moon phase at release (in decreasing order of importance). The number of days to median day of recapture of each batch decreased as the season progressed and decreased with increasing water discharge. Water temperature did not explain any of the remaining variation in the model, even if there was a significant correlation between water temperature at release and median day at recapture of each batch (in simple linear regression model). Recapture rate during the same migration season varied strongly with water temperature, but at most 33{\%} of the variation could be explained by this factor. It was aiso evident that the recapture rate increased when the number of downward migrating untagged silver eels was high. Day length (i.e. time at release) did not explain any of the remaining variation in recapture rate.},

Leaf area index decreased significantly with elevation by about 1.1 per 1000 m altitude; from a mean of about 6.6 at 500 m to 5.2 at 2000 m a.s.l., while diffuse transmittance increased significantly with elevation. Diffuse transmittance at the forest floor averaged 2.1 {\%} at 500 m and 4.0 {\%} at 2000 m (relative to incident radiation). There were significant positive relationships between both tree species diversity and stem density on the one hand and leaf area-index on the other, whereas both were negatively related to diffuse transmittance. The observed decrease in leaf area index with elevation appears to be a consequence of an altitudinal decrease in stern density and in tree species diversity, combined with a soil fertility effect.},

abstract = {Summary 1. The need to understand the processes shaping population distributions has resulted in a vast increase in the diversity of spatial wildlife data, leading to the development of many novel analytical techniques that are fit-for-purpose. One may aggregate location data into spatial units (e.g. grid cells) and model the resulting counts or presence–absences as a function of environmental covariates. Alternatively, the point data may be modelled directly, by combining the individual observations with a set of random or regular points reflecting habitat availability, a method known as a use-availability design (or, alternatively a presence – pseudo-absence or case–control design). 2. Although these spatial point, count and presence–absence methods are widely used, the ecological literature is not explicit about their connections and how their parameter estimates and predictions should be interpreted. The objective of this study is to recapitulate some recent statistical results and illustrate that under certain assumptions, each method can be motivated by the same underlying spatial inhomogeneous Poisson point process (IPP) model in which the intensity function is modelled as a log-linear function of covariates. 3. The Poisson likelihood used for count data is a discrete approximation of the IPP likelihood. Similarly, the presence–absence design will approximate the IPP likelihood, but only when spatial units (i.e. pixels) are extremely small (Electric Journal of Statistics, 2010, 4, 1151–1201). For larger pixel sizes, presence–absence designs do not differentiate between one or multiple observations within each pixel, hence leading to information loss. 4. Logistic regression is often used to estimate the parameters of the IPP model using point data. Although the response variable is defined as 0 for the availability points, these zeros do not serve as true absences as is often assumed; rather, their role is to approximate the integral of the denominator in the IPP likelihood (The Annals of Applied Statistics, 2010, 4, 1383–1402). Because of this common misconception, the estimated exponential function of the linear predictor (i.e. the resource selection function) is often assumed to be proportional to occupancy. Like IPP and count models, this function is proportional to the expected density of observations. 5. Understanding these (dis-)similarities between different species distribution modelling techniques should improve biological interpretation of spatial models and therefore advance ecological and methodological cross-fertilization.},

Models developed to simulate estuaries use to be also complex and, henceforth, difficult to constrain and parameterize. Here, we propose a simple biogeochemical model of the water column of temperate estuaries based on previously published, well-known models of marine pelagic ecosystems. This model has fewer parameters which are usually well constrained and is more easy to implement and analyze than more complex models. We demonstrate that this model setup could be satisfactorily used to simulate estuarine ecosystems if light availability (constrained by suspended material in the water column) is the main limitation of biological productivity. The proposed model can also be used to assess expected changes in the environmental status of such systems by anthropogenic activity or by climate change. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The most common species were Miconia theaezans, Piper andreanum, and Miconia pustulata with 32{\%}, 14{\%} and 8{\%} of the individuals, respectively. Three species (Hesperomeles lanuginosa, Boehmeria fallax and Lamiaceae sp.) were represented by only a single individual. Melastomataceae was the most important family with six species, over 50{\%} of the individual trees, and 68{\%} of the basal area. Other important families were Piperaceae and Asteraceae. The abundance of assumed pioneer species suggests that either the forest has been altered by humans in the past, or  that their dominance is a part of the dynamic regeneration of a forest growing on steep slopes with inclinations between 36 and 120{\%} in the plot. The diameter class distribution of Miconia corymbiformis and Axinaea macrophylla shows a light-demanding species behavior. Trees with multiple stems characterize this forest perhaps in order to distribute their weight on such steep slopes.},

abstract = {1. A positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship is one of the most robust patterns in macroecology. Yet, the mechanisms driving this pattern are poorly understood. Here, we use biological traits of freshwater macroinvertebrates to gain a mechanistic understanding and disentangle the various explanations. We ask whether mechanisms underlying the abundance-occupancy relationship differ between species, and whether information on individual species can be used to explain their contribution to the interspecific relationship. 2. We test the hypothesis that the importance of metapopulation dynamics or niche differences in explaining the relationship differs between species, varying in relation to their habitat breadth. In addition, we analyse how a species' biological traits shape its habitat breadth and its abundance and occupancy. 3. The abundance and occupancy of the 234 different aquatic macroinvertebrate species were strongly and positively related. Marked differences were found between habitat specialists and habitat generalists in the goodness-of-fit of abundance-occupancy relationships. The occupancy-frequency distribution was bimodal for habitat generalists, allowing 'satellite species' to be distinguished from 'core species'. 4. Habitat generalists appeared to be more widespread but less abundant than habitat specialists, suggesting that the jack-of-all-trades may be master-of-none. Species traits (trophic position and other life-history traits) explained a significant part of the variation around the general relationship. Among habitat specialists, more species showed synchronized life cycles, a low dispersal capacity or clustered oviposition, being better adapted to predictable habitats. Among habitat generalists, more species had long-lived adults, spreading reproductive effort in time and space, and were strong dispersers, being better adapted to unpredictable habitats. 5. Interspecific abundance-occupancy relationships can be best understood by examining the contribution of individual species. For habitat specialists, the interplay between niche differences (diet and habitat use) and the underlying spatial distribution of environmental conditions result in competitive displacement and differences in species' success. For habitat generalists, differences in colonization and extinction rates between species are more important. Therefore, both metapopulation dynamics and niche differences can operate simultaneously but apply to different species, thus constituting different endpoints of the same continuum.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an essential tool in understanding species ranges, but models haven ' t incorporated disturbance-related variables. T is is true even for regions where long histories of disturbance have resulted in disturbance- adapted species. T erefore, the degree to which including disturbance-related variables in SDMs might improve their performance is unclear. We used hierarchical partitioning to determine how fi re patterns contribute to variation in species abundance and presence, examining both the total variation disturbance-related variables explained, and how much of this variation is independent of soil and climate variables. For 27 Proteaceae species in the fi re-adapted Cape Floristic Region of South Africa , we found that fi re variability, frequency, and area burned tended to have explanatory power similar in size to that of soil and climate variables. Importantly, for SDMs of abundance, fi re-related variables explained additional variation not captured by climatic variables, resulting in markedly increased model performance. In systems with high disturbance rates, species are less likely to be in equilibrium with their environment, and SDMs including variables describing distur- bance regimes may be better able to capture the probability of a species being present at a site. Finally, the diff erential eff ect of fi re on species abundance and presence suggests functional diff erences between these responses, which could hamper attempts to make predictions about species abundances using models of presence.},

abstract = {The concepts of age, residence time, exposure time and influence time provide space and time dependent quantitative measures of the rate at which water masses and pollutants enter and/or leave a control domain. To help avoid confusion between these concepts, this paper provides clear definitions of the residence time and the influence time. The similarities and differences between them are illustrated using both a simplified 1D advection-diffusion model and a realistic two-dimensional model of the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands).The residence time of a water parcel in a control domain is the time taken by this parcel to leave the control domain for the first time. The influence time is the time required to replace the water in the domain of interest by renewing water. For steady flows, the influence time is numerically identical to the age of the renewing water, but the two timescales differ for unsteady flows.The residence time measures the influence of a hypothetical point discharge on a control domain. In environmental studies, it provides a measure of the effectiveness of hydrodynamic processes at helping a semi-enclosed basin to recover from a local pollution event. The influence time quantifies the local influence of a tracer that would be uniformly distributed in the control domain at the initial time. It is therefore a relevant diagnostic tool in impact studies focusing on the local persistence of a pollution problem initially affecting a large domain. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The high Andes region of south Ecuador is characterised by intense land use changes. These changes affect particularly the p{\'{a}}ramo, which is a collection of high altitudinal grassland ecosystems. In this region, the interaction between airborne volcanic ashes and the cold and wet climate results in very typical soils, with an elevated organic C contents. The physical soil properties are closely related to the high and reliable base flow in rivers descending from the p{\'{a}}ramo, which makes them important for the socio-economic development of the region. In this study, we analyse the regional variability of the soils in the south Ecuadorian rio Paute basin. In a first part of the study, data from soil profiles along north-south transects are used to determine the soil properties, and to relate the spatial variability of these properties to the major trends in parent material, volcanic ash deposits and climate. The profiles are Histic Andosols and Dystric Histosols devoid of allophane, with very high amounts of organic matter. Significant differences between the western and central mountain range are observed, as well as a general decrease in Andic properties from north to south, coinciding with the decrease in volcanic influence. Finally, the impact of human activities on the soil properties is assessed in a case study in the Machangara valley. Data from 5 profiles, located in an area with natural grass vegetation and a low degree of human impact are compared with 4 profiles in a heavily disturbed, intensively drained cultivated area. Despite the intensity of the land use, very few significant differences are found. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We have explored changes in atmospheric parameters from global climate model simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum and for doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (2 x CO2) conditions which are associated with the height of this cloud formation, and hence the occurrence of intact cloud forests. These parameters include vertical profiles of absolute and relative humidity surfaces, as well as the warmth index(1), an empirical proxy of forest type. For the glacial simulations, the warmth index and absolute humidity suggest a downslope shift of cloud forests that agrees with the available palaeodata. For the 2 x CO2 scenario, the relative humidity surface is shifted upwards by hundreds of metres during the winter dry season when these forests typically rely most on the moisture from cloud contact. At the same time, an increase in the warmth index implies increased evapo-transpiration. This combination of reduced cloud contact and increased evapo-transpiration could have serious conservation implications, given that these ecosystems typically harbour a high proportion of endemic species and are often situated on mountain tops or ridge lines.},

abstract = {Macroinvertebrates were sampled in the Chaguana river basin in SW Ecuador in the wet season (March) and the dry season (September) of 2005 and 2006. To assess the robustness of several biological indicators, correlations were calculated between both years and between the wet and the dry season. In addition, it was tested if the indices gave significantly different results for sites with a bad, poor, moderate and good ecological water quality. Composition measures performed poorly in most cases, however, abundance, diversity and richness measures often performed better and tolerance measures, the so-called biotic indices, performed very well, even indices developed for temperate regions. By using pruned multitarget clustering trees, it was possible to predict several well-performing ecological water quality indices simultaneously on the basis of the occurring key macroinvertebrate taxa or, alternatively, on the basis of key environmental variables. In contrast to unpruned trees, which resulted in complex trees that were difficult to interpret and performed inferiorly, pruning resulted in transparent trees. Water quality indices scored high when Hydropsychidae were present and even higher when in addition also Megapodagrionidae were present. When no Hydropsychidae nor Libellulidae were present, the indices reached the lowest scores. However, this model based on key taxa occurrences did not perform well during validation. Water quality indices scored higher with increasing dissolved oxygen concentrations and a strong current velocity. The latter model based on environmental variables also performed well during validation. In the presented study, the ecological water quality could thus be accurately predicted solely on the basis of dissolved oxygen concentration and current velocity. It can therefore be concluded that multitarget clustering trees can be easily used as a practical tool for cost-effective decision support by water quality managers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

There were 97 tree species, 76 shrubs, 70 vines, 181 terrestrial herbs, 39 epiphytes, 3 hemiparasites, 3 succulent rosette shrubs and 1 saprophyte. 3 Forest composition varied continuously with altitude, based on the Shipley {\&} Keddy (1987) test, ordination via reciprocal averaging, and elevational trends in the Sorenson similarities of samples at adjacent altitudes. supporting the individualistic hypothesis of plant community organization. 4 Understorey herbs, shrubs and vines showed the greatest decline in species number with increasing altitude. This pattern is hypothesized to result from the more open, more frequently disturbed, and more completely deciduous canopies at lower, drier elevations. The proportion of evergreen woody plants was greater at higher altitudes, reflecting less seasonal aridity and greater soil leaching. The proportion of endozoochorous species increased with altitude, while the proportion of pterochorous and ectozoochorous species decreased, reflecting trends in the hypothesized efficacy of these mechanisms of seed dispersal. 5 Total basal area of woody plants {\textgreater} 2.5 cm d.b.h. and basal area per tree both increased roughly fourfold between 1500 and 2500 m. 6 Species richness decreased sharply with altitude, due mainly to decreases in terrestrial herbs, and (to a lesser extent) shrubs and vines. The average number of species per 0.1 ha declined from 134 at 1500 m to 43 at 2500 m. The numbers of species, genera and families per sample declined linearly with elevation. Species composition of samples within an altitudinal band showed greater horizontal turnover ($\beta$ diversity) at lower elevations, showing that low-elevation forests are not only locally more diverse, but spatially more patchy. Community composition varies roughly six times as rapidly with elevation as with the same distance horizontally. 7 A cascading series of effects of elevation on soil fertility, anti-herbivore defences, and the level of density-dependent mortality may account for the observed drop in diversity with elevation, and would be consistent with lower $\beta$ diversity and greater basal area at higher elevations.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional circulation model of the Chesapeake Bay is used to validate a simple data assimilation scheme, using high-resolution salinity data acquired from a ship-towed undulating vehicle (a Scanfish). The simulation period spans the entire year of 1995 during which the high-resolution Scanfish data were available in July and October, lasting a few days each. Since Scanfish data were irregularly distributed in time and space, only salinity fields are nudged in the model for simplicity. Model improvements through data assimilation are evaluated from a pair of experiments: one with data assimilation and one without. Data from scattered Chesapeake Bay Program monitoring stations and a few stations maintained by the National Ocean Service inside the bay are used independently to check the model performance. In general, the simple assimilation scheme leads to visibly improved density structures in the upper and middle reaches of the bay. The improvement in the lower bay is equally pronounced after data assimilation but diminishes in a shorter timescale because of faster flushing from the adjacent coastal ocean. Moderate to weak nudging normally enhances the gravitational circulation. Strong nudging may produce transient overshooting, during which the gravitational circulation is renewed vigorously.},

Our objective was therefore to assess the controls of N, P, and S release, immobilization, and transport in a remote tropical montane forest. The study forest is located on steep slopes of the northern Andes in Ecuador. We determined the concentrations of NO3-N, NH4-N, dissolved organic N (DON), PO4-P, dissolved organic P (DOP), SO4-S, dissolved organic S (DOS), and dissolved organic C (DOC) in rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, lateral flow (in the organic layer), litter leachate, mineral soil solution, and stream water of three 8–13 ha catchments (1900–2200 m a.s.l.). The organic forms of N, P, and S contributed, on average, 55, 66, and 63{\%} to the total N, P, and S concentrations in all ecosystem fluxes, respectively.The organic layer was the largest source of all N, P, and S species except for inorganic P and S. Most PO4 was released in the canopy by leaching and most SO4 in the mineral soil by weathering. The mineral soil was a sink for all studied compounds except for SO4. Consequently, concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic N and P were as low in stream water (TDN: 0.34– 0.39 mg N l 1, P not detectable) as in rainfall (TDN: 0.39–0.48 mg N l 1, P not detectable), whereas total S concentrations were elevated (stream water: 0.04–0.15, rainfall: 0.01–0.07 mg S l 1). Dissolved N, P, and S forms were positively correlated with pH at the scale of soil peda except inorganic S. Soil drying and rewetting promoted the release of dissolved inorganic N. High discharge levels following heavy rainstorms were associated with increased DOC, DON, NO3-N and partly also NH4-N concentrations in stream water. Nitrate-N concentrations in the stream water were positively correlated with stream discharge during the wetter period of the year. Our results demonstrate that the sources and sinks of N, P, and S were element-specific. More than half of the cycling N, P, and S was organic. Soil pH and moisture were important controls of N, P, and S solubility at the scale of individual soil peda whereas the flow regime influenced the export with stream water.},

abstract = {Physiological studies focus on the responses of cells, tissues and individuals to stressors, usually in laboratory situations. Conservation and management, on the other hand, focus on populations. The field of conservation physiology addresses the question of how abiotic drivers of physiological responses at the level of the individual alter requirements for successful conservation and management of populations. To achieve this, impacts of physiological effects at the individual level need to be scaled to impacts on population dynamics, which requires consideration of ecology. Successfully realizing the potential of conservation physiology requires interdisciplinary studies incorporating physiology and ecology, and requires that a constructive dialogue develops between these traditionally disparate fields. To encourage this dialogue, we consider the increasingly explicit incorporation of physiology into ecological models applied to marine fish conservation and management. Conservation physiology is further challenged as the physiology of an individual revealed under laboratory conditions is unlikely to reflect realized responses to the complex variable stressors to which it is exposed in the wild. Telemetry technology offers the capability to record an animal's behaviour while simultaneously recording environmental variables to which it is exposed. We consider how the emerging insights from telemetry can strengthen the incorporation of physiology into ecology.},

abstract = {Aim To analyse the structure of pteridophyte assemblages, based on phylogenetic relatedness and trait properties, along an elevational gradient. Ecological theory predicts that co-occurring species may be: randomly selected from a regional pool; ecologically sorted so that they are functionally different hence resulting in reduced competition (overdispersion); or functionally similar as an adaptation to specific ecological conditions (clustering). Location Braulio Carrillo National Park and Cerro de la Muerte, Costa Rica, Central America. Methods We used an empirical dataset of the quantitative pattern of species occurrences and individual numbers of ferns within 156 plots along a tropical elevational gradient to test whether directed ecological sorting might cause deviations in patterns of trait and phylogenetic diversity. Mean pairwise distances of species based on phylogenetic and trait properties were compared with two different sets of null assemblages, one maintaining species frequency distributions (constrained) and one not (unconstrained). Results Applying different null models resulted in varying degrees of overdispersion and clustering, but overall patterns of deviation from random expectations remained the same. Contrary to theoretical predictions, phylogenetic and trait diversity were relatively independent from one another. Phylogenetic diversity showed no patterns along the elevational gradient, whereas trait diversity showed significant trends for epiphytes. Main conclusions Under stressful environmental conditions (drought at low elevations and frost at high elevations), epiphytic fern assemblages tended to be clustered with respect to trait characteristics, which suggests environmental filtering. Conversely, under less extreme environmental conditions (middle of the transect), the sorting was biased towards high differentiation (overdispersion), presumably because of interspecific competition and trait shifts among closely related species (character displacement).},

All functions were fitted using weighted nonlinear least squares regression (wi = 1/DBHi) because of the problem of unequal error variance. The examination and comparison of the weighted mean squared errors, the asymptotic t-statistics for the parameters, and the plots of studentized residuals against the predicted height show that many concave and sigmoidal functions can be used to describe the height–diameter relationships. The sigmoidal functions such as the Weibull-type function, the modified logistic function, the Chapman–Richards function, and the Schnute function generally gave the most satisfactory results.},

abstract = {Contaminated sediment management is an urgent environmental and regulatory issue worldwide. Because remediation is expensive, sound quantitative assessments of uncertainty aboutthe spatial distribution of contaminants are critical, butthey are hampered bythe physical complexity of sediment environments. This paper describes the use of geostatistical modeling approaches to quantify uncertainty of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin concentrations in Passaic River (New Jersey) sediments and to incorporate this information in decision-making processes, such as delineation of contaminated areas and additional sampling needs. First, coordinate transformation and analysis of three-dimensional semivariograms were used to describe and modelthe directional variability accounting forthe meandering course of the river. Then, indicator kriging was employed to provide models of local uncertainty at unsampled locations without requiring a prior transform (e.g. log-normal) of concentrations. Cross-validation results show that the use of probability thresholds leads to more efficient delineation of contaminated areas than a classification based on the exceedence of regulatory thresholds by concentration estimates. Depending on whether additional sampling aims at reducing prediction errors or misclassification rates, the variance of local probability distributions or a measure of the expected closeness to the regulatory threshold can be used to locate candidate locations.},

abstract = {Southern Flounder Paralichthys lethostigma supports a multimillion dollar commercial and recreational fishery in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite its economic importance, the Southern Flounder population has been declining for decades. To improve the management of this fishery, both population trends and changes in environmental conditions need to be considered. Using two different statistical modeling techniques, boosted regression tree (BRT) and artificial neural network (ANN), a 29-year fisheries-independent record of juvenile Southern Flounder abundance in Texas was examined to illustrate how environmental factors influence the temporal and spatial distribution of juvenile Southern Flounder. Boosted regression trees show the presence of juvenile Southern Flounder is closely associated with relatively low temperatures, low salinity levels, and high dissolved oxygen concentrations. Both ANN and BRT models resulted in high predictive performance with slight spatial differences in predicted distribution. Both models suggested high probability of occurrence in Galveston Bay and East Matagorda Bay. The ANN accurately predicted higher probability of occurrence in Sabine Lake compared with the BRT model. Our results will provide tools for fisheries managers to enhance management and sustainability of the Southern Flounder population. Moreover, these results also identify a predictive framework for proactive approaches to ecosystem management by providing more data to identify essential habitat features and understanding relationships between abiotic and biotic factors within those habitats.

In 2002, residency times were generally less than 1 h, although some fish dem-onstrated residency between 71 and 118 h. In 2004, after plant refurbishing, fish took from 6 to 11 days to reach the power plant and remained in the tailrace area from 3 to 12 days. Frequent entrances into the tailraces indicated fish were demonstrating a searching behaviour to find the upstream migration route. In 2003 and 2004, EMG data were collected from 3 fish in each year migrating to, and past, the tailraces. An Energy Index was calculated integrating EMG signal and time spent at each location to estimate potential energetic cost. Relatively high-energy expendi-ture was associated with tailrace attraction and residency in both years. In 2003, fish spent highest energy at the lowest tailrace (first encountered in their migration) while in 2004, there were also high-energy costs associated with a new generat-ing unit. In both years, high EMGs both just below and above the power plant suggested these reaches were arduous and difficult to pass.},

Our understanding of the patterns of fine root turnover is limited, in particular in tropical forests, despite its acknowledged importance in the global carbon cycle. We used the minirhizotron technique for studying the changes in fine root longevity and turnover along a 2000-m-elevational transect in the tropical mountain forests of South Ecuador. Fine root growth and loss rates were monitored during a 5-mo period at intervals of four weeks with each 10 minirhizotron tubes in three stands at 1050, 1890, and 3060 m asl. Average root loss rate decreased from 1.07 to 0.72 g/g/yr from 1050 to 1890 m, indicating an increase in mean root longevity with increasing elevation. However average root loss rate increased again toward the uppermost stand at 3060 m (1.30 g/g/yr). Thus, root longevity increased from lower montane to mid-montane elevation as would be expected from an effect of low temperature on root turnover, but it decreased further upslope despite colder temperatures. We suggest that adverse soil conditions may reduce root longevity at high elevations in South Ecuador, and are thus additional factors besides temperature that control root dynamics in tropical mountain forests.},

abstract = {For many decades, pike populations in Belgium have been suffering from a decline of the environmental quality due to habitat deterioration, water pollution and many other degrading phenomena. Since past attempts to rehabilitate the pike populations had only limited success, it is of importance to gain insight into the spatio-temporal dynamics of pike such that more effective restoration programs can be effectuated in the future. Ideally, this can be accomplished by relying on telemetry data, but since the collection of such data is both labour-intensive and costly, researchers often resort to a simulation-based approach, which on its turn requires a sound spatio-temporal model. Therefore, and as a first step towards an integrated individual-based model (IBM) for describing pike dynamics in rivers, an IBM mimicking the movement of pike in the river Yser, Belgium, is proposed in this paper. This model considers the specificities of pike, such as its seasonally dependent migration, swimming speed and habitat preference, and is based upon environmental data from the river Yser.

Over the past decade, technological advances in telemetry have transformed our ability to observe aquatic animal behavior and movement. These advances are now providing unprecedented ecological insights by connecting animal movements with measures of their physiology and environment. These developments are revolutionizing the scope and scale of questions that can be asked about the causes and consequences of movement and are redefining how we view and manage individuals, populations, and entire ecosystems. The next advance in aquatic telemetry will be the development of a global collaborative effort to facilitate infrastructure and data sharing and management over scales not previously possible.},

abstract = {Steady-state numerical solutions are obtained for a two-dimensional, vertically stratified model of a partially mixed estuary. The boundary at the seaward end of the estuary is considered to be open, with the profiles of salinity, vorticity and streamfunction obtained by extrapolating interior dynamics out to the boundary. A salinity source is maintained at the bottom at the mouth. Zero salt flux is required at a free-slip top and no-slip bottom boundary. Zero salinity and a parabolic velocity profile are maintained at the head of the estuary. A number of cases are run for various estuarine parameters; the river transport and Rayleigh number being the two parameters that have the most pronounced effect. The river transport is varied by adjusting the mean freshwater velocity, Uf. Decreasing Uf allows salt as well as the stagnation or null point to penetrate upstream. The estuarine circulation weakens, but expands over a larger portion of the estuary. The position of the stagnation point, with respect to the seaward boundary, varies as Uf
- 5 8 for Uf {\textgreater} 1 cm/s and as Uf
- 5 6 for Uf {\textless} 1 cm/s. Increasing the Rayleigh number, by deepening the estuarine channel, H, results in an increased circulation as well as strong intrusion of salinity and inward migration of the stagnation point. The horizontal location of the stagnation point is found to be proportional to Ra and therefore, varies as H3. ?? 1976.},

abstract = {Knowledge of population dynamics is essential for managing and conserving wildlife. Traditional methods of counting wild animals such as aerial survey or ground counts not only disturb animals, but also can be labour intensive and costly. New, commercially available very high-resolution satellite images offer great potential for accurate estimates of animal abundance over large open areas. However, little research has been conducted in the area of satellite-aided wildlife census, although computer processing speeds and image analysis algorithms have vastly improved. This paper explores the possibility of detecting large animals in the open savannah of Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya from very high-resolution GeoEye-1 satellite images. A hybrid image classification method was employed for this specific purpose by incorporating the advantages of both pixel-based and object-based image classification approaches. This was performed in two steps: firstly, a pixel-based image classification method, i.e., artificial neural network was applied to classify potential targets with similar spectral reflectance at pixel level; and then an object-based image classification method was used to further differentiate animal targets from the surrounding landscapes through the applications of expert knowledge. As a result, the large animals in two pilot study areas were successfully detected with an average count error of 8.2{\%}, omission error of 6.6{\%} and commission error of 13.7{\%}. The results of the study show for the first time that it is feasible to perform automated detection and counting of large wild animals in open savannahs from space, and therefore provide a complementary and alternative approach to the conventional wildlife survey techniques.},

At each station, water irradiance reflectance R($\lambda$) spectra were acquired by ocean optic 2000 spectroradiometers. Simultaneously, concentrations of chlorophyll a and total suspended solids, as well as absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were measured. This paper focused on the relationships between reflectance R($\lambda$) spectra and the in situ bio-optical constituents. A principal component analysis was conducted to characterize the general variability of reflectance R($\lambda$) spectra, and a Canonical Correspondence Analysis was further performed to explore the relationships between spectral reflectance and water optically active constituents in coastal environments. The results suggested that water reflectance spectra in estuarine waters are the results of complex interactions among phytoplankton pigments, total suspended solids, and CDOM. The first principal component, which represents 72{\%} of total variance of R($\lambda$), is affected by backscattering of total suspended solids, and the absorption of CDOM at blue-green region of spectra; while the second principal component that representing 20{\%} of variation of R($\lambda$), is mainly driven by the absorption of Chlorophyll a in red and near infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the results of this study could provide insights for using hyperspectral remote sensing as a cost effective approach for monitoring water quality in coastal waters.},

abstract = {Reliable information on fish stocks is given crucial importance in fisheries science and ecosystem management. Among others, the European Water Framework Directive calls for consistent sampling methods that provide comparable and reproducible results. However, the standardized sampling of fish in lakes by gillnets is conducted by low effort only in the pelagic areas, thus potentially not reflecting between-lake variability in fish density. Here, we compared two additional fishing methods, hydroacoustics and midwater trawl sampling, to estimate pelagic coregonid densities in two deep lakes. Night-time trawling was conducted in four different depth layers and compared with the simultaneously obtained abundance and biomass estimates from echo recordings. Overall areal fish biomass from both methods corresponded to each other (R2=0.40), with slope and intercept of major axis regression not differing from unity. However, we found differences in estimates for the deepest layers fished, and for very small and the largest coregonids, most likely to be explained by the specific technological details of either method. Our study supports that either hydroacoustics or trawl sampling should accompany gillnet fishing to monitor pelagic fish assemblages. Because both methods result in estimates of absolute fish densities per volume or area, their application may uncover subtle responses of fish assemblages to anthropogenic disturbance in deep lakes. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the colonization of restored river reaches by fish depends on the regional species pools; however, quantifications of the relationship between the composition of the regional species pool and restoration outcome are lacking. We analyzed data from 18 German river restoration projects and adjacent river reaches constituting the regional species pools of the restored reaches. We found that the ability of statistical models to describe the fish assemblages established in the restored reaches was greater when these models were based on 'biotic' variables relating to the regional species pool and the ecological traits of species rather than on 'abiotic' variables relating to the hydromorphological habitat structure of the restored habitats and descriptors of the restoration projects. For species presence in restored reaches, 'biotic' variables explained 34{\%} of variability, with the occurrence rate of a species in the regional species pool being the most important variable, while 'abiotic' variables explained only the negligible amount of 2{\%} of variability. For fish density in restored reaches, about twice the amount of variability was explained by 'biotic' (38{\%}) compared to 'abiotic' (21{\%}) variables, with species density in the regional species pool being most important. These results indicate that the colonization of restored river reaches by fish is largely determined by the assemblages in the surrounding species pool. Knowledge of species presence and abundance in the regional species pool can be used to estimate the likelihood of fish species becoming established in restored reaches.},

Due to the experimental design it was possible to investigate additional objectives, such as the influence of particle shape on rate of sediment movement and on height of grain leap during saltation. The data obtained indicate that all three variables exerted a certain inJiuence on the average particle size trapped at a given height, whereas the sorting and skewness of the material trapped at any e1evation were affected to a significant extent only by Changes in the initial surface size frequency distribution. Particle shape was found to playa definite role in rate of sediment movement: at slow winds, rate of sediment flow increased with decrease in particle shape, while at fast winds the opposite effect oCcurred.

With limited direct measures of soil N cycling at the global scale, syntheses of the 15N:14N ratio of soil organic matter across climate gradients provide key insights into understanding global patterns of N cycling. In synthesizing data from over 6000 soil samples, we show strong global relationships among soil N isotopes, mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and the concentrations of organic carbon and clay in soil. In both hot ecosystems and dry ecosystems, soil organic matter was more enriched in 15 Nthan in corresponding cold ecosystems or wet ecosystems. Below aMATof 9.86C, soil d15 Nwas invariant with MAT. At the global scale, soil organic C concentrations also declined with increasing MAT and decreasing MAP. After standardizing for variation among mineral soils in soil C and clay concentrations, soil d15 N showed no consistent trends across global climate and latitudinal gradients. Our analyses could place new constraints on interpretations of patterns of ecosystemNcycling and global budgets of gaseous N loss.},

abstract = {Litter-induced pulses of nutrient availability could play an important role in the productivity and nutrient cycling of forested ecosystems, especially tropical forests. Tropical forests experience such pulses as a result of wet-dry seasonality and during major climatic events, such as strong El Ni{\~{n}}os. We hypothesized that (1) an increase in the quantity and quality of litter inputs would stimulate leaf litter production, woody growth, and leaf litter nutrient cycling, and (2) the timing and magnitude of this response would be influenced by soil fertility and forest age. To test these hypotheses in a Costa Rican wet tropical forest, we established a large-scale litter manipulation experiment in two secondary forest sites and four old-growth forest sites of differing soil fertility. In replicated plots at each site, leaves and twigs ({\textless} 2 cm diameter) were removed from a 400-m2 area and added to an adjacent 100-m2 area. This transfer was the equivalent of adding 5-25 kg/ha of organic P to the forest floor. We analyzed leaf litter mass, [N] and [P], and N and P inputs for addition, removal, and control plots over a two-year period. We also evaluated basal area increment of trees in removal and addition plots. There was no response of forest productivity or nutrient cycling to litter removal; however, litter addition significantly increased leaf litter production and N and P inputs 4-5 months following litter application. Litter production increased as much as 92{\%}, and P and N inputs as much as 85{\%} and 156{\%}, respectively. In contrast, litter manipulation had no significant effect on woody growth. The increase in leaf litter production and N and P inputs were significantly positively related to the total P that was applied in litter form. Neither litter treatment nor forest type influenced the temporal pattern of any of the variables measured. Thus, environmental factors such as rainfall drive temporal variability in litter and nutrient inputs, while nutrient release from decomposing litter influences the magnitude. Seasonal or annual variation in leaf litter mass, such as occurs in strong El Ni{\~{n}}o events, could positively affect leaf litter nutrient cycling and forest productivity, indicating an ability of tropical trees to rapidly respond to increased nutrient availability.},

abstract = {New conceptual models that highlight the importance of environmental, rather than molecular, controls on soil organic matter affect interpretations of organic matter (OM) persistence across terrestrial and aquatic boundaries. We propose that changing paradigms in our thinking about OM decomposition explain some of the uncertainties surrounding the fate of land-derived carbon (C) in marine environments. Terrestrial OM, which historically has been thought to be chemically recalcitrant to decay in soil and aquatic environments, dominates inputs to rivers yet is found in trace amounts in the ocean. We discuss three major transformations in our understanding of OM persistence that influence interpretations of the fate of aquatic OM: (1) a shift away from an emphasis on chemical recalcitrance as a primary predictor of turnover; (2) new interpretations of radiocarbon ages, which affect predictions of reactivity; and (3) the recognition that most OM leaving soils in dissolved form has been microbially processed. The first two explain rapid turnover for terrigenous OM in aquatic ecosystems once it leaves the soil matrix. The third suggests that the presence of terrestrial OM in aquatic ecosystems may be underestimated by the use of plant biomarkers. Whether these mechanisms occur in isolation of each other or in combination, they provide insight into the missing terrestrial C signature in the ocean. Spatially and temporally varying transformations of OM along land-water networks require that common terrestrial source indicators be interpreted within specific environmental contexts. We identify areas of research where collaborations between aquatic and terrestrial scientists will enhance quantification of C transfer from soils to inland water bodies, the ocean, and the atmosphere. Accurate estimates of OM processing are essential for improving predictions of the response of vulnerable C pools at the interface of soil and water to changes in climate and land use. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

An alternative option to evaluate using farmer knowledge is thus necessary but this can be sound after verified scientifically in the context of each region. The present study aims to evaluate SQ status (categories) identified by local farmers using scientific soil measurements, and assess their potential as indicators of soil degradation for decision making in the Mai-Negus catchment, northern Ethiopia. In this study, the scientifically measured soil attributes significantly differed (P ??? 0.05) among the SQ categories identified by the local farmers. Using variables retained in the four identified component factors, discriminant analysis identified soil porosity to be the most powerful variable that can help discriminate the SQ status. The study shows that farmer derived SQ status (low, medium, high) could be crucial in providing basis for management and policy decision making as validated by analytical components.

Here we use long-term datasets from three New Zealand marine reserves to evaluate the capacity of underwater visual census monitoring to quantify trends in abundance for four reef-fish species. Simulations parameterized by the observed data were used to evaluate multiple monitoring configurations based on statistical power and trend-estimate precision and accuracy. These results were then used to identify optimal monitoring designs that maximized power, precision or accuracy within budgetary constraints. Power and trend-estimate accuracy and precision were highest for abundant species and lowest for species exhibiting low and/or highly variable abundances. For the least abundant species, trend estimates were less accurate and precise for negative compared to positive trends, highlighting a reduced ability to identify ongoing declines in depleted populations. Optimal monitoring configurations varied amongst species, locations and whether assessments were based on power, precision or accuracy. In general, higher within-site replication was required for the least abundant species, whereas greater site replication was required for more spatially heterogeneous species/locations. In addition, we found that for some species the optimal monitoring approach changes through time, highlighting the need for an adaptive approach to monitoring. Finally, we recommend that future monitoring evaluations focus on assessing precision and accuracy, rather than power, as this places greater emphasis on the assessment of biological rather than statistical significance.},

abstract = {A 3-D coupled biophysical model ECOSMO (ECOSystem MOdel) has been developed. The biological module of ECOSMO is based on lower trophic level interactions between two phyto- and two zooplankton components. The dynamics of the different phytoplankton components are governed by the availability of the macronutrients nitrogen, phosphate and silicate as well as light. Zooplankton production is simulated based on the consumption of the different phytoplankton groups and detritus. The biological module is coupled to a nonlinear 3-D baroclinic model. The physical and biological modules are driven by surface forcing at temporal scale of 6 h using atmospheric re-analysis data. The model was integrated for 1984 and 1986. The simulated fields for 1984 were used to investigate the annual spatial distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and their production in the North Sea. A detailed validation showed that the model, based on consideration of limiting processes, is able to reproduce the observed spatial and seasonal variability of the North Sea ecosystem e.g. the spring bloom, summer sub-surface production and the fall bloom. Distinct differences in regional characteristics of diatoms and flagellates could be modeled and their different roles in the seasonal cycle were resolved by ECOSMO. Moreover, the model was able to describe seasonal and regional characteristics of zooplankton biomass. In contrast to earlier models ECOSMO was able to identify frontal environments as zones of high productivity, and the simulations characterized the dynamics of different zooplankton feeding environments with special emphasis on the role of frontal production. For the second trophic level the regional increase of production in the frontal zone was found to be several times higher than for the first trophic level. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, we analyzed the regeneration potential from the soil seed bank and monitored the development of the diversity of woody species in the natural succession at the different sites. Our results show that dependence on natural regeneration for forest recovery cannot be an acceptable solution for forest users, due to the low speed of recovery and the insufficient species composition of the regeneration. Planted seedlings of native species are able to cope with the harsh conditions if they are selected according to their adaptation to the environmental characteristics of the respective planting sites.},

abstract = {The 3-D coupled biophysical model ECOSMO (ECOSystem MOdel) has been applied to simulate the spatial and temporal variability of primary and secondary production and biomass in the North Sea in 1984. In order to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of these components, statistical methods based on empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOF) are introduced to biological oceanography and ecosystem research as valuable tool to investigate spatial temporal variability. These methods are used to describe the spatial temporal characteristics of the seasonal signal of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and production in the North Sea. Employing these techniques made it possible to separate regional and temporal variability into the annual pattern, its temporal characteristics and some basic regional modulations of the average seasonal signal. The analysis was able to identify the modulation of average seasonal characteristics with for example earlier blooming in the south and later blooming in the northwestern North Sea. The simulated temporal development of diatom and flagellate blooms showed clear and unique temporal characteristics. The diatom bloom was characterized by a sharp peak occurring between middle of March and the end of April, with little to no diatom biomass in the second half of summer. Conversely flagellate biomass did not peak before the beginning of May and showed a relatively constant summer production and an autumn bloom. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {High altitude tropical regions have been heavily deforested and offer large areas for carbon offsets by secondary forest regeneration. However, a general assumption exists that productivity, and thus, carbon sequestration of high altitude forests is low, but the scarcity of data from high altitude tropical forests does not allow for a sound confirmation of this assumption. To determine the carbon sequestration potential of natural forest regeneration and reforestation efforts at high altitudes, aboveground biomass was quantified of several successional stages of two monospecific secondary forests in the high Ecuadorian Andes. The studied forests were, at 3200 m, an Alnus acuminata forest with 8-, 20-, 30- and 45-year-old stands and, at 3600 m, a Polylepis incana forest with 6-, 15- and 30-year-old stands and old growth forest without known age. Both trees are pioneer species. Additionally, a soil survey was conducted and leaf N/P ratios and N and P retranslocation rates were determined. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) estimates of the oldest stages of the two forests were 241 Mg ha-1 for the Alnus and 366 Mg ha-1 for the Polylepis forest. Productivity, expressed as annual aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) was in both forests highest in the establishment phase (14.2 and 15.0 Mg ha-1 per year at 8 and 6 years, respectively) due to high sapling numbers, and then slowed down significantly (5.9 and 6.9 Mg ha-1 per year, respectively at age 30). TAGB and ABA figures of the investigated forests are comparable to those of lowland tropical forests and do not indicate a significant decrease of these parameters at higher altitudes in the tropics. Analysis of site conditions, ecological requirements and ecophysiological properties of the tree species indicated that in both cases an optimal combination of these factors strongly favoured forest growth. It is not possible to verify whether our forests are representative for other high altitude tropical forests or if they should be treated as exceptional cases. The results do show, however, that high carbon offsets at high altitudes are possible. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The ratios of 15 N: 14 N in plants and soils have been used as indirect indices of N cycling parameters, yet our understanding of controls over N isotope ratios in plants and soils is still developing. Scope In this review, we provide background on the main processes that affect plant and soil N isotope ratios. In a similar manner to partitioning the roles of state factors and interactive controls in determining ecosys-tem traits, we review N isotopes patterns in plants and soils across a number of proximal factors that influence ecosystem properties as well as mechanisms that affect these patterns. Lastly, some remaining questions that would improve our understanding of N isotopes in terrestrial ecosystems are highlighted. Conclusion Compared to a decade ago, the global pat-terns of plant and soil N isotope ratios are more resolved. Additionally, we better understand how plant and soil N isotope ratios are affected by such factors as mycorrhizal fungi, climate, and microbial processing. A comprehen-sive understanding of the N cycle that ascribes different degrees of isotopic fractionation for each step under different conditions is closer to being realized, but a number of process-level questions still remain.},

abstract = {A numerical model of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) was verified using water current data from twenty sites, and applied to estimate the flushing time and age of waters. These timescales were calculated under different wind and oceanic inflow conditions. The age of oceanic waters intruding in the GBR was estimated to be between 3 and 5 months on leaving the GBR, depending on the location; the largest residence time prevailed in the southern GBR matrix where the age was the highest within the high density reef matrix, indicating veering of the mean currents around the GBR matrix. The flushing time depends on the size of the domain, and was estimated to be 67 days for the whole central GBR. For the flushing of coastal waters the wind had two effects. Firstly, it increased the flushing times by generating wind-driven currents, transporting some water back to the source; this process is comparable to that of an estuary, where water that leaves the estuary at ebb tide may return at flood tide, a process parameterized by the return coefficient. The return coefficient in the GBR due to wind reversals may be as large as 50{\%} at the timescale of the wind. Secondly, in the southern and central regions of the GBR, the southeasterly tradewind deflected the southward flowing oceanic inflow seaward, away from the inner shelf and towards the outer shelf, making room for a wind-driven current of opposite direction on the inner shelf. Thus the intrusion of oceanic water in the GBR depends on the wind over the GBR. The veering of the mean currents around the GBR reef matrix and the wind over the shelf influencing the oceanic circulation demonstrate small scales (the GBR shelf) influencing the large scale oceanic circulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Nutrient limitation (mostly N or P) is a driving force in ecosystem development. Current techniques to determine the nature of nutrient limitation use laborious fertilization experiments. 2. It was hypothesized that the N:P ratio of the vegetation directly indicates the nature of nutrient limitation on a community level (N vs. P limitation). This hypothesis was tested by reviewing data on fertilization studies in a variety of European freshwater wetland ecosystems (bogs, fens, wet heathlands, dune slacks, wet grasslands). In a subset of the data (dune slacks) between-site intraspecific variation and within-site interspecific variation in nutrient content and N:P ratio was studied in five plant species. 3. A review of 40 fertilization studies reveals that an N:P ratio {\textgreater}16 indicates P limitation on a community level, while an N:P ratio {\textless}14 is indicative of N limitation. At N:P ratios between 14 and 16, either N or P can be limiting or plant growth is colimited by N and P together. In only one out of 40 fertilization studies, the N:P ratio gave a false indication of the nature of nutrient limitation. Measuring the N:P ratio of the vegetation is a simple and cheap alternative to fertilization studies. The method can only be used under conditions where either N or P controls plant growth. 4. The dataset contains a large variety of vegetation types and plant species, and 11 of the 40 sites were near-monocultures. This suggests that interspecific differences in critical N:P ratios among species may be insignificant. However, a rigorous test of this hypothesis is required. 5. A survey in 18 dune slacks showed large within-site variation in N:P ratio among five species (Calamagrostis epigejos, Phragmites australis, Lycopus europaeus, Mentha aquatica and Eupatorium cannabinum). The N:P ratios of the five species suggested that within plant communities species can be differentially limited by N or P. Moreover, species with an N:P ratio that suggested P-limitation were found at sites where N controlled community biomass production, and vice versa. Between-site intraspecific variation in N and P contents and N:P ratios was also large, and about equal for the five species. This illustrates the plasticity of plant species with respect to N and P contents, probably in response to differences in N and P supply ratios. 6. The vegetation N:P ratio is of diagnostic value and its use may increase our understanding of numerous facets of physiological, population, community and ecosystem ecology.},

abstract = {One objection to the stocking of translocated eels as a management measure for the European eel Anguilla anguilla L. is that these eels may lack the ability to find their way back to the spawning area in the Sargasso Sea because the translocation will confuse their imprinted nav- igation. We undertook a series of tagging experiments using satellite tags, data storage tags and acoustic tags to test the hypothesis that eels translocated 1200 km from the UK to Sweden differed in their ability to migrate compared to naturally recruited eels. Eels to be tagged were caught in 2 locations, one with a record of eel stocking for more than 20 yr and with a series of barriers to upstream migration and another in a river with only natural immigration and without barriers to upstream migration. In the first year, the naturally recruited and stocked eels were released in a fjord where the initial escapement behaviour could be monitored by acoustic tagging in addition to using archival tags to track the subsequent marine migration. In the second year, eels were tagged with archival or satellite tags and released on the open coast, and only their marine migra- tion was investigated. Eels were tracked more than 2000 km along a route that, after leaving the Skagerrak, followed the Norwegian Trench to the Norwegian Sea, turned south and west along the Faroe-Shetland channel before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, and then continued west. There were no statistically significant differences in estuarine or oceanic behaviour regarding route, swimming speed and preferred swimming depth between stocked and naturally recruited eels. These results provide the first empirical evidence of a Nordic migration route and do not sup- port the hypothesis that a sequential imprinting of the route during immigration is necessary for adequate orientation or behaviour during the adult spawning migration.},

Environmental monitoring of large river networks are based on measurement stations. Compared to the total length of river networks, their number is often limited and there is a need to extend environmental variables that are measured locally to the whole river network. The objective of this paper is to propose several relevant geostatistical models for river modelling. These models use river distance and are based on two contrasting assumptions about dependency along a river network. Inference using maximum likelihood, model selection criterion and prediction by kriging are then developed. We illustrate our approach on two variables that differ by their distributional and spatial characteristics: summer water temperature and nitrate concentration. The data come from 141 to 187 monitoring stations in a network on a large river located in the Northeast of France that is more than 5000km long and includes Meuse and Moselle basins. We first evaluated different spatial models and then gave prediction maps and error variance maps for the whole stream network. Copyright{\textcopyright}2009},

abstract = {Sequential density fractionation separated soil particles into "light" predominantly mineral-free organic matter vs. increasingly "heavy" organo-mineral particles in four soils of widely differing mineralogy. With increasing particle density C concentration decreased, implying that the soil organic matter (OM) accumulations were thinner. With thinner accumulations we saw evidence for both an increase in C-14-based mean residence time (MRT) of the OM and a shift from plant to microbial origin. Evidence for the latter included: (1) a decrease in C/N, (2) a decrease in lignin phenols and an increase in their oxidation state, and (3) an increase in delta C-13 and delta N-15. Although bulk-soil OM levels varied substantially across the four soils, trends in OM composition and MRT across the density fractions were similar. In the intermediate density fractions (similar to 1.8-2.6 g cm(-3)), most of the reactive sites available for interaction with organic molecules were provided by aluminosilicate clays, and OM characteristics were consistent with a layered mode of OM accumulation. With increasing density (lower OM loading) within this range, OM showed evidence of an increasingly microbial origin. We hypothesize that this microbially derived OM was young at the time of attachment to the mineral surfaces but that it persisted due to both binding with mineral surfaces and protection beneath layers of younger, less microbially processed C. As a result of these processes, the OM increased in MRT, oxidation state, and degree of microbial processing in the sequentially denser intermediate fractions. Thus mineral surface chemistry is assumed to play little role in determining OM composition in these intermediate fractions. As the separation density was increased beyond similar to 2.6 g cm(-3), mineralogy shifted markedly: aluminosilicate clays gave way first to light primary minerals including quartz, then at even higher densities to various Fe-bearing primary minerals. Correspondingly, we observed a marked drop in delta N-15, a weaker decrease in extent of microbial processing of lignin phenols, and some evidence of a rise in C/N ratio. At the same time, however, C-14-based MRT time continued its increase. The increase in MRT, despite decreases in degree of microbial alteration, suggests that mineral surface composition (especially Fe concentration) plays a strong role in determining OM composition across these two densest fractions.},

Criteria for selecting traits were that they could be applied to most taxa, were easily available, and their inclusion would result in new research and/or management applications. Numerical traits were favoured over categorical. Habitat was excluded as it can be derived from a selection of these traits. Ten traits were prioritized for inclusion in the most comprehensive open access database on marine species (World Register of Marine Species), namely taxonomic classification, environment, geography, depth, substratum, mobility, skeleton, diet, body size and reproduction.

abstract = {Soil microorganisms regulate fundamental biochemical processes in plant litter decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) transformation. Understanding how microbial communities respond to changes in vegetation is critical for improving predictions of how land cover change affects belowground carbon storage and nutrient availability. We measured intra- and interannual variability in soil and forest litter microbial community composition and activity via phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and extracellular enzyme activity across a well-replicated, long-term chronosequence of secondary forests growing on abandoned pastures in the wet subtropical forest life zone of Puerto Rico. Microbial community PLFA structure differed between young, secondary forests and older secondary and primary forests, following successional shifts in tree species composition. These successional patterns held across seasons, but the microbial groups driving these patterns differed over time. Microbial community composition from the forest litter differed greatly from those in the soil, but did not show the same successional trends. Extracellular enzyme activity did not differ with forest succession, but varied by season with greater rates of potential activity in the dry seasons. We found few robust significant relationships among microbial community parameters and soil pH, moisture, carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Observed inter- and intrannual variability in microbial community structure and activity reveal the importance of a multiple, temporal, sampling strategy when investigating microbial community dynamics with land-use change. Successional control over microbial composition with forest recovery suggests strong links between above and belowground communities.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Aim  This study investigates how estimated tree aboveground biomass (AGB) of tropical montane rain forests varies with elevation, and how this variation is related to elevational change in floristic composition, phylogenetic community structure and the biogeography of the dominant tree taxa.Location  Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia.Methods  Floristic inventories and stand structural analyses were conducted on 13 plots (each 0.24 ha) in four old-growth forest stands at 1050, 1400, 1800 and 2400 m a.s.l. (submontane to upper montane elevations). Tree AGB estimates were based on d.b.h., height and wood specific gravity. Phylogenetic diversity and biogeographical patterns were analysed based on tree family composition weighted by AGB. Elevational trends in AGB were compared with other Southeast Asian and Neotropical transect studies (n =7).Results  AGB was invariant from sub- to mid-montane elevation (309-301 Mg ha-1) and increased slightly to 323 Mg ha-1 at upper montane elevation. While tree and canopy height decreased, wood specific gravity increased. Magnoliids accounted for most of the AGB at submontane elevations, while eurosids I (including Fagaceae) contributed substantially to AGB at all elevations. Phylogenetic diversity was highest at upper montane elevations, with co-dominance of tree ferns, Podocarpaceae, Trimeniaceae and asterids/euasterids II, and was lowest at lower/mid-montane elevations, where Fagaceae contributed {\textgreater} 50{\%} of AGB. Biogeographical patterns showed a progression from dominant tropical families at submontane to tropical Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus) at lower/mid-montane, and to conifers and Australasian endemics at upper montane elevations. Cross-continental comparisons revealed an elevational AGB decrease in transects with low/no presence of Fagaceae, but relatively high AGB in montane forests with moderate to high abundance of this family.Main conclusions  AGB is determined by both changes in forest structure and shifts in species composition. In our study, these two factors traded off so that there was no net change in AGB, even though there were large changes in forest structure and composition along the elevational gradient. Southeast Asian montane rain forests dominated by Fagaceae constitute important carbon stocks. The importance of biogeography and species traits for biomass estimation should be considered by initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and in taxon choice in reforestation for carbon offsetting.},

Digital video technology is rapidly improving, and it is now possible to record long periods of high resolution digital imagery cost effectively, making single or stereo-video systems one of the primary sampling tools. However, manual species identification, counting, and measuring of fish in stereo-video images is labour intensive and is the major disincentive against the uptake of this technology. Automating species identification using technologies developed by researchers in computer vision and machine learning would transform marine science. In this article, a new paradigm of image set classification is presented that can be used to achieve improved recognition rates for a number of fish species. State-of-the-art image set construction, modelling, and matching algorithms from computer vision literature are discussed with an analysis of their application for automatic fish species identification. It is demonstrated that these algorithms have the potential of solving the automatic fish species identification problem in underwater videos captured within unconstrained environments.},

abstract = {1. The climates of two rain forest sites, one montane (altitude 1710 m) and one lowland (altitude 380 m) are described. There is a cooler, wetter season at both, lasting approximately from April to July. 2. The weather at the montane site is analysed; two types of day, `fog-bound' and `fog-free', are distinguished. On typical fog-bound days the forest is shrouded in stratus cloud for much of the time. On typical fog-free days there are prolonged sunny periods. Groups of fog-bound and fog-free days probably alternate throughout the year, the fog-free periods lasting up to 1 or 2 weeks in the dry season. No such division into extreme weather types is possible for the lowland forest; no fog was encountered here. 3. Detailed observations have been made on the temperature and relative humidity during 3-week periods in the undergrowth of the two forests and also in large clearings where the conditions are believed to have approximated to those in the upper part of the forest canopy. 4. On fog-bound days the temperature change in the montane forest undergrowth is very small and the relative humidity rarely falls below 95{\%}. On fog-free days the diurnal range in temperature and the minimum relative humidity are about the same as on average days in the lowland forest. A similar parallel is found for conditions in the clearings. 5. The daily march of atmospheric conditions is followed in detail. On fog-free days in the montane forest and on average days in the lowland it approaches that already described for lowland forests elsewhere during the dry season; on fog-bound days in the montane forest it approaches that described for lowland forests in the wet season. The severely desiccating periods, taken arbitrarily as those with relative humidity {\$}\backslasheqslantless 80{\%}{\$} , are of approximately equal duration and frequency on fog-free days in the montane forest and on average days in the lowland. 6. It is shown that the results probably represent a generally valid comparison of montane and lowland forest climates in the part of Ecuador visited. The importance and general occurrence of dry periods as well as frequent fog, even in Upper Montane Forest, is stressed. 7. The factors controlling the distribution of the three rain forest formation-types on tropical mountains (Lowland, Lower Montane and Upper Montane) are discussed. A consideration of the Massenerhebung effect leads to the conclusion that the forest types are primarily correlated with the frequency of fog (stratus or cumulus cloud close to the ground) rather than with any aspect of the temperature regime. The Massenerhebung effect arises in the tropics because clouds form at lower altitudes where the air masses are moister before lifting and cooling, i.e. when over the sea or approaching the foothills of a large massif. Exposure to high winds and soil factors are important in producing stunted facies of each of the three types, including so-called `Elfin woodland'. 8. The greater abundance of epiphytes in the montane forest than in the lowland is related to the more frequent wetting with liquid water from fog rather than to a constantly higher humidity.

abstract = {Many species vary in their ecology across their geographic ranges in response to gradients in environmental conditions. Such variation, which can influence life history traits and subsequent demography of populations, usually occurs over large spatial scales. However, describing and understanding the causes of such variation is difficult precisely because it occurs over such large spatial scales. In this study, we document spatial variation in the ecology of a common reef fish, Stegastes beebei, in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands and test a number of potential causal mechanisms. The pattern resembles that seen in latitudinal variation: individuals are larger, occur in higher densities, and live longer in the coldest region of the islands than those in the warmest region. However, in this system, demography varies among regional populations separated by {\textless}150 km. Preferred nutritious algae are more available in the cold region and comprise a greater proportion of the diet of fish in this region. Per gram reproductive effort appears to be strongly related to temperature, despite differences in the gross magnitude and timing of reproduction in different regions. A model of reproductive output suggests that fish in the warmest region are allocating a greater proportion of available energy to reproduction, resulting in apparent regional life history tradeoffs. Our data suggest that regional demographic differences in S. beebei may be driven by a combination of variation in food availability and an environmentally mediated life history tradeoff.},

abstract = {We used forest inventories, conducted in seventy-two 1-ha permanent plots to assess the variation in tree and palm aboveground live biomass (AGLB), and its relation with soil gradients (texture and nutrients) and topography (altitude and slope). Our plots, located at Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, a 10,000 ha reserve in central Amazonia, near the city of Manaus, were systematically spread over 64 km2. The plots were long (250 m) and narrow (up to 40 m), following elevational contours. Chemical and physical soil analyses were undertaken using topsoil samples, collected in each plot. The plots covered a soil textural gradient ranging from 8{\%} to 98{\%} percent of sand, slopes varying from 0.5?? to 27??, and the maximum difference of altitude among plots was 70 m, ranging from 39 to 109 m a.s.l. The mean total AGLB (palm + trees) for stems over 1 cm diameter breast height (dbh = 1.3 m), was 327.8 Mg/ha (ranging from 210.9 to 426.3) and was similar to other studies in the region. We found a two-fold variation in total AGLB estimates among plots, with soil or topography explaining around 20{\%} of this variation. AGLB was positively related to either a soil textural gradient (represented by the percentage of clay) or altitude, but was insensitive to slope. Although slope had no detectable effect on the mean variation of AGLB per plot, it explained 14{\%} of the AGLB in understory and emergent trees. On slopes, AGLB is concentrated mostly in tree classes of small size (1 ??? dbh {\textless} 10 cm), whereas in flat areas, most of the biomass is concentrated in a few big trees. When considering palms and trees separately, we found that tree biomass tended to increase in clay-rich soils (mostly located in high areas), whereas palm biomass was higher in sandy soils (low slopes and bottomlands). This study shows that forests in central Amazonia grow in a heterogeneous environment in relation to soil and topography, and this heterogeneity seems to be in part responsible for differences in structure and AGLB accumulation. In the forest around Manaus, topography can be used to predict aboveground live biomass as an alternative to soil variables, with similar predictive power. Topographic variables can be easily assessed using satellite imagery and could improve current estimates of carbon stocks over large areas in the Amazon. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Animal movement has been the focus on much theoretical and empirical work in ecology over the last 25 years. By studying the causes and consequences of individual movement, ecologists have gained greater insight into the behavior of individuals and the spatial dynamics of populations at increasingly higher levels of organization. In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, first passage time, L{\'{e}}vy flights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability.},

TMCF are among the most threatened of ecosystems under current predicted global warming scenarios. We conducted an intensive soil sampling campaign extending 40 km along the tree line in the Peruvian Andes between 2994 and 3860 m asl to quantify SOC stocks of TMCF, puna grassland, and shrubland sites in the transition zone between the two habitats. SOC stocks from the soil surface down to the bedrock averaged (±standard error SE) 11. 8 (±1.5, N = 24) kg C/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in TMCF, 14.7 (±1.4, N = 9) kg C/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the shrublands and 11.9 (±0.8, N = 35) kg C/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the grasslands and were not significantly different (P {\textgreater} 0.05 for all comparisons). However, soil profile analysis revealed distinct differences, with TMCF profiles showing a uniform SOC distribution with depth, shrublands a linear decrease, and puna sites an exponential decrease in SOC densities with soil depth. Organic soil layer thickness reached a maximum ({\~{}}70 cm) at the upper limit of the TMCF and declined with increasing altitude toward puna sites. Within TMCF, no significant increase in SOC stocks with increasing altitude was observed, probably because of the large variations among SOC stocks at different sites, which in turn were correlated with spatial variation in soil depth. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Channel geometry in tidally influenced river deltas can show a mixed scaling behavior between that of river and tidal channel networks, as the channel forming discharge is both of river and tidal origin. We present a method of analysis to quantify the tidal signature on delta morphology, by extending the hydraulic geometry concept originally developed for river channel networks to distributary channels subject to tides. Based on results from bathymetric surveys, a systematic analysis is made of the distributary channels in the Mahakam Delta (East Kalimantan, Indonesia). Results from a finite element numerical model are used to analyze the spatial variation of river and tidal discharges throughout the delta. The channel geometry of the fluvial distributary network scales with bifurcation order, until about halfway the radial distance from the delta apex to the sea. In the seaward part of the delta, distributary channels resemble funnel shaped estuarine channels. The break in morphology, which splits the delta into river- and tide-dominated parts, coincides with a break in the ratio between tidal to fluvial discharges. Downstream hydraulic geometry exponents of the cross-sectional area show a transition from the landward part to the seaward part of the delta. The numerical simulations show that the tidal impact on river discharge division at bifurcations increases with the bifurcation order, and that the variation of river discharge throughout the network is largely affected by the tides. The tidal influence is reflected by the systematic variation of downstream hydraulic geometry exponents.},

Their migratory behavior was apparently correlated with various environmental factors, particularly photoperiod, water temperature, lunar phase, and passage of atmospheric depressions, and was similar to the behavior of the species in European waters. These findings suggest that transplanted European eels retain their ability to respond to environmental cues for seaward migration in similar temperate habitats. The timing of the migration of silver European eels coincided with that of the native Japanese eels A. japonica, suggesting that the silver European eel was synchronized physiologically with the native eel by the same environmental factors. {\textcopyright} 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/IRD/Cemagref/{\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {Reliable estimates of the habitat areas of major marine producer,groups were needed in support of an ecosystem modeling effort in the macrotidal Cobscook Bay, ME. Results needed to be comprehensive, synoptic, objective, affordable, and on a suitable spatial scale. We chose to address these goals by applying accepted procedures utilizing existing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and a computer-generated unsupervised classification. Unsupervised classification of high and low tide Landsat TM images yielded coherent habitat maps that were supported by reference data and independent habitat analyses. The high tide image revealed surface water patterns that supported the existence of a large, Central Bay dipole eddy predicted by a numerical three-dimensional circulation model. Classification of the low tide image resulted in 14 intertidal and water habitat classes being defined. Overall accuracy of the classification was 86{\%}. Good agreement in habitat areas existed between the affordable and easily repeatable satellite survey and four other Cobscook Bay surveys which differed methodologically and temporally. The four studies agreed within 7{\%} of total habitat area and 12{\%} on intertidal habitat area. The area of both brown and green algae in the Bay apparently increased modestly over a 25-year period which saw the introduction of large-scale salmon aquaculture and the advent of intensive dragging for scallops and sea urchins. The increase in both groups is inconsistent with changes induced by nutrient additions observed elsewhere. Landsat imagery appears to be a valuable tool for the management and monitoring of macrotidal environments.},

abstract = {(1) Litter production and the quantity of litter remaining on the ground were monitored for a 12-month period in undisturbed Lower Montane Rain forest at an altitude of c. 2400-2500 m in the Eastern Highlands of New Guinea. Four sites, each 20 × 10 m, were studied in contrasting situations; one site (on a ridge) was a natural gap caused by the fall of a large tree, and the other three sites (on a broad ridge, on a steep slope and in a valley bottom) were of well-developed, mature or late-building phase trees. (2) At each site litter fall was measured in sixteen traps 1 × 1 m. The average litter production for the four sites was 755 ± 27 (s.e.m.) g m-2 yr-1 (non-woody material 635 ± 20 gm-1), and no significant differences were found between the sites. (3) It is estimated that about 10{\%} of the leaf dry weight is grazed by phytophagous insects, and a further 10{\%} is withdrawn by the trees before the leaves are shed. Density measurements made on healthy twigs, and on twigs in the litter fall, suggest that considerable decomposition occurs before the twigs fall as litter. (4) Estimates of the annual rate parameter for litter disappearance, based on the relationship between the standing crop of litter on the ground and the annual litter production, range between 1.04 for the Ridge Site and 1.55 for the Valley Site. (5) The decomposition of leaf litter of six tree species (Dacrycarpus cinctus, Elaeocarpus ptilanthus, Litsea sp. 65, Macaranga albescens, Planchonella firma and Schizomeria sp. 203) and a widespread bamboo (Nastus productus) was studied over 325 days at the Ridge and Valley Sites by enclosing the litter in plastic mesh. There were no significant differences between the two sites. (6) Only 15{\%} of the original dry weight of leaves of Elaeocarpus ptilanthus remained after 325 days. Leaves of other tree species disappeared more slowly (57-74{\%} of the dry weight remained). Of the bamboo leaves 56{\%} remained. (7) The average rate of disappearance for the seven species, equivalent to 47-48{\%} in the first year, is much less than the rate calculated from the standing crop of litter and the annual litter production (100-148{\%} for non-woody litter); this and other evidence suggests that the time-course of disappearance is linear rather than exponential.

abstract = {Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal- dependent process- es of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer- resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becom- ing dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source- sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better- suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

abstract = {Carbon storage and sequestration in tropical mountain forests and their dependence on elevation and temperature are not well understood. In an altitudinal transect study in the South Ecuadorian Andes, we tested the hypotheses that (i) aboveground net primary production (ANPP) decreases continuously with elevation due to decreasing temperatures, whereas (ii) belowground productivity (BNPP) remains constant or even increases with elevation due to a shift from light to nutrient limitation of tree growth. In five tropical mountain forests between 1050 and 3060 m a.s.l., we investigated all major above- and belowground biomass and productivity components, and the stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC). Leaf biomass, stemwood mass and total aboveground biomass (AGB) decreased by 50{\%} to 70{\%}, ANPP by about 70{\%} between 1050 and 3060 m, while stem wood production decreased 20-fold. Coarse and large root biomass increased slightly, fine root biomass fourfold, while fine root production (minirhizotron study) roughly doubled between 1050 and 3060 m. The total tree biomass (above- and belowground) decreased from about 320 to 175 Mg dry mass ha-1, total NPP from ca. 13.0 to 8.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1. The belowground/aboveground ratio of biomass and productivity increased with elevation indicating a shift from light to nutrient limitation of tree growth. We propose that, with increasing elevation, an increasing nitrogen limitation combined with decreasing temperatures causes a large reduction in stand leaf area resulting in a substantial reduction of canopy carbon gain toward the alpine tree line. We conclude that the marked decrease in tree height, AGB and ANPP with elevation in these mountain forests is caused by both a belowground shift of C allocation and a reduction in C source strength, while a temperature-induced reduction in C sink strength (lowered meristematic activity) seems to be of secondary importance.},

abstract = {Our knowledge of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics during stand development is not only essential for evaluating the role of secondary forests in the global terrestrial C cycle, but also crucial for understanding long-term C-N interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. However, a comprehensive understanding of forest C and N dynamics over age sequence remains elusive due to the diverse results obtained across individual studies. Here, we synthesized the results of more than 100 studies to examine C and N dynamics during forest stand development. Our results showed that C accumulated in aboveground vegetation, litter and forest floor pools, while the mineral soil C pool did not exhibit significant changes in most studies. The rate of C changes declined with stand age and approached equilibrium during the later stage of stand development. The rate of N changes exhibited linear increases with that of C changes, indicating that N also accrued in various ecosystem components except mineral soil. These results demonstrate that substantial increases in C pools over age sequence are accompanied by N accretion in forest ecosystems. The concurrent C and N dynamics suggest that forest ecosystems may have an intrinsic ability to preclude progressive N limitation during stand development.},

abstract = {Vascular epiphytes are a conspicuous and highly diverse group in tropical wet forests; yet, we understand little about their mineral nutrition across sites. In this study, we examined the mineral nutrition of three dominant vascular epiphyte groups: ferns, orchids, and bromeliads, and their host trees from samples collected along a 2600 m elevational gradient in the tropical wet forests of Costa Rica. We predicted that the mineral nutrition of ferns, orchids, and bromeliads would differ because of their putative differences in nutrient acquisition mechanisms and nutrient sources-atmospherically dependent, foliar feeding bromeliads would have lower nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations and more depleted delta(15)N values than those in canopy soil-rooted ferns because canopy soil is higher in available N, and more enriched in delta(15)N than the atmospheric sources of precipitation and throughfall. We also predicted that epiphyte foliar chemistry would mirror that of host trees because of the likely contribution of host trees to the nutrient cycle of epiphytes via foliar leaching and litter contributions to canopy soil. In the same vein, we predicted that epiphyte and host tree foliar chemistry would vary with elevation reflecting ecosystem-level nutrients-soil N availability increases and P availability decreases with increasing elevation. Our results confirmed that canopy soil-rooted epiphytes had higher N concentrations than atmospheric epiphytes; however, our predictions were not confirmed with respect to P which did not vary among groups indicating fixed P availability within sites. In addition, foliar delta(15)N values did not match our prediction in that canopy soil-rooted as well as atmospheric epiphytes had variable signatures. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) on foliar measurements determined that ferns, orchids, and bromeliads are statistically distinct in mineral nutrition. We also found that P concentrations of ferns and orchids, but not bromeliads, were significantly correlated with those of host trees indicating a possible link in their mineral nutrition's via canopy soil. Interestingly, we did not find any patterns of epiphyte foliar chemistry with elevation. These data indicate that the mineral nutrition of the studied epiphyte groups are distinct and highly variable within sites and the diverse uptake mechanisms of these epiphyte groups enhance resource partitioning which may be a mechanism for species richness maintenance in tropical forest canopies.},

abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forest hydrology is complex because of the presence of epiphytic life-forms that increase canopy surfaces and fog persistency. Fog precipitation is a hydrological input common to cloud forests, and forms when fog droplets are intercepted by the canopy and fall to the forest floor. Interception and fog precipitation was determined for a 2100m site and a 2550m site in a first-order tributary of the Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve, Guatemala by calculating the difference between throughfall and gross precipitation for a 44-week period. Both sites were situated within closed-canopy cloud forests. The 2100m site was on the windward slope of Monta??a de Miranda near the lower boundary of the cloud forest and the 2550m site was at the summit. Fog precipitation was found during periods in which throughfall exceeds gross precipitation. Fog precipitation was greater at 2550m than at 2100m. Data collected by precipitation and throughfall gauges demonstrate the existence of seasonal fog precipitation with the greatest fog precipitation occurring in the dry season (November-April). Fog precipitation contributes approximately 1mm per day to the hydrological budget of the cloud forest at 2550m during the dry season, and 0.5mm per day during the rainy season (May-October). ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Historical biogeography has become narrowly focused on using phylogenies to discover the history of geological connections among regions. Conversely, ecologists often ignore historical biogeography, even when its input can be crucial. Both historical biogeographers and ecologists have more-or-less abandoned attempts to understand the processes that determine the large-scale distribution of clades. Here, we describe the chasm that has developed between ecology and historical biogeography, some of the important questions that have fallen into it and how it might be bridged.

abstract = {Nutrient limitation to primary productivity and other biological processes is widespread in terrestrial ecosystems, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most common limiting elements, both individually and in combination. Mechanisms that drive P limitation, and their interactions with the N cycle, have received less attention than mechanisms causing N limitation. We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. The best known of these is depletion-driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long-term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a "terminal steady state" of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P-containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low-P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low-P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P. Similarly, demand-independent losses and constraints to N fixation can control the ecosystem-level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient.},

Also mesh refinement and adaptation must be sufficient to resolve variations in the computed variable(s). Here, we present an unstructured hybrid finite element, node-centred finite-volume discretization suitable for solving fluid flow, reactive transport, and mechanical partial differential equations on a complex geometry with inhomogeneous material domains. We show that resulting meshes accurately capture free-form material interfaces as defined by non-uniform rational B-spline curves and surfaces. The mesh discretization error is analysed for the elliptic pressure equation and an error metric is introduced to guide mesh refinement. Finite elements and finite volumes are represented in parametric space and integrations are conducted numerically. Subsequently, integral properties are mapped to physical space using Jacobian transformations. This method even retains its validity when the mesh is deformed. The resulting generic formulation is demonstrated for a transport calculation performed on a complex discrete fracture model.},

abstract = {The terrestrial carbon (C) cycle has received increasing interest over the past few decades, however, there is still a lack of understanding of the fate of newly assimilated C allocated within plants and to the soil, stored within ecosystems and lost to the atmosphere. Stable carbon isotope studies can give novel insights into these issues. In this review we provide an overview of an emerging picture of plant-soil-atmosphere C fluxes, as based on C isotope studies, and identify processes determining related C isotope signatures. The first part of the review focuses on isotopic fractionation processes within plants during and after photosynthesis. The second major part elaborates on plant-internal and plant-rhizosphere C allocation patterns at different time scales (diel, seasonal, interannual), including the speed of C transfer and time lags in the coupling of assimilation and respiration, as well as the magnitude and controls of plant-soil C allocation and respiratory fluxes. Plant responses to changing environmental conditions, the functional relationship between the physiological and phenological status of plants and C transfer, and interactions between C, water and nutrient dynamics are discussed. The role of the C counterflow from the rhizosphere to the aboveground parts of the plants, e. g. via CO(2) dissolved in the xylem water or as xylem-transported sugars, is highlighted. The third part is centered around belowground C turnover, focusing especially on above-and belowground litter inputs, soil organic matter formation and turnover, production and loss of dissolved organic C, soil respiration and CO(2) fixation by soil microbes. Furthermore, plant controls on microbial communities and activity via exudates and litter production as well as microbial community effects on C mineralization are reviewed. A further part of the paper is dedicated to physical interactions between soil CO(2) and the soil matrix, such as CO(2) diffusion and dissolution processes within the soil profile. Finally, we highlight state-of-the-art stable isotope methodologies and their latest developments. From the presented evidence we conclude that there exists a tight coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes involved in C cycling and C isotope fluxes in the plant-soil-atmosphere system. Generally, research using information from C isotopes allows an integrated view of the different processes involved. However, complex interactions among the range of processes complicate or currently impede the interpretation of isotopic signals in CO(2) or organic compounds at the plant and ecosystem level. This review tries to identify present knowledge gaps in correctly interpreting carbon stable isotope signals in the plant-soil-atmosphere system and how future research approaches could contribute to closing these gaps.},

We present both direct and indirect evidence of anthropogenic influences on cloud forest tree line location; these human influences should be incorporated in definitions of Andean tree lines as (1) the extensification of grassland for grazing and potato cultivation for the upper limit, and (2) the intensification of the agricultural frontier, fuelwood gathering, and timber extraction for the lower limit. Although we do not claim to fully debunk the prevalent paradigm of tree line dynamics (which is descriptive, depends on the natural sciences, and sees tree lines as physically controlled), we hope to achieve increased recognition for a challenging alternate view of tropical tree lines as functional, resource-use dependent, and human-driven. Management plans and overall tropical montane cloud forest conservation strategies need to consider this new perspective and incorporate a proactive and assertive approach toward restoration of Andean forests in a way that will encourage landscape diversity in tropical mountain ecoregions.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that tree growth in tropical low-elevation forests is primarily limited by phosphorus while nitrogen limitation is more prominent in tropical montane forests where temperature is lower and the soils are poorly developed. We tested this hypothesis in mountain rainforests of South Ecuador by investigating the growth response of tree fine roots to N, P and K fertilization in ingrowth cores exposed at 1050 m (pre-montane) and 3060 m (upper montane) elevation. Root growth into unfertilized ingrowth cores (control treatment) was about 10 times slower at 3060 m than at 1050 m. At 1050 m, root growth was stimulated not only by P, but also by N and K. In contrast, N was the only element to promote root growth at 3060 m. The N concentration in fine root biomass dropped to nearly a third between 1050 and 3060 m, those of P, K, Ca and Mg decreased as well, but to a lesser degree. According to a 15NO315NH4 tracer study along the slope, tree fine roots accumulated nitrate and ammonium in root biomass at similar rates between 1050 and 3060 m, despite lower temperatures higher upslope. We conclude that the nature of nutrient limitation of tree fine root growth changes with elevation from an apparent co-limitation by P together with N and K at 1050 m to predominant N limitation at 3060 m, which is also reflected by low foliar N concentrations. Increasing N limitation may have caused the high fine root biomass and root/shoot ratio in the high elevation forest, while the capability of the roots to acquire mineral N apparently was not affected by lower temperatures at high elevations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Considerable technical developments over the past half century have enabled widespread application of electronic tags to the study of animals in the wild, including in freshwater environments. We review the constraints associated with freshwater telemetry and biologging and the technical developments relevant to their use. Technical constraints for tracking animals are often influenced by the characteristics of the animals being studied and the environment they inhabit. Collectively, they influence which and how technologies can be used and their relative effectiveness. Although radio telemetry has historically been the most commonly used technology in freshwater, passive integrated transponder (PIT) technology, acoustic telemetry and biologgers are becoming more popular. Most telemetry studies have focused on fish, although an increasing number have focused on other taxa, such as turtles, crustaceans and molluscs. Key technical developments for freshwater systems include: miniaturization of tags for tracking small-size life stages and species, fixed stations and coded tags for tracking large samples of animals over long distances and large temporal scales, inexpensive PIT systems that enable mass tagging to yield population- and community-level relevant sample sizes, incorporation of sensors into electronic tags, validation of tag attachment procedures with a focus on maintaining animal welfare, incorporation of different techniques (for example, genetics, stable isotopes) and peripheral technologies (for example, geographic information systems, hydroacoustics), development of novel analytical techniques, and extensive international collaboration. Innovations are still needed in tag miniaturization, data analysis and visualization, and in tracking animals over larger spatial scales (for example, pelagic areas of lakes) and in challenging environments (for example, large dynamic floodplain systems, under ice). There seems to be a particular need for adapting various global positioning system and satellite tagging approaches to freshwater. Electronic tagging provides a mechanism to collect detailed information from imperilled animals and species that have no direct economic value. Current and future advances will continue to improve our knowledge of the natural history of aquatic animals and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems while facilitating evidence-based resource management and conservation.

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated modelling approach to simulate and assess ecological effects of physical habitat changes in rivers. An ecohydraulic simulation tool was created by combining a 1D hydraulic model based on HEC-RAS software and the fish habitat module of CASiMiR, a fuzzy logic-based ecohydraulic modelling system. This tool was applied on a river stretch commonly occurring in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe. In particular the effect of weir removal on habitat suitability for bullhead (Cottus gobio L.) was simulated. Physical conditions of the studied stretch after weir removal were simulated with a hydraulic model. CASiMiR linked these conditions to ecological expert knowledge to calculate habitat suitability for three life stages of bullhead at four different flow rates based on fuzzy logic. Results indicated that after weir removal, habitat suitability increased significantly for all life stages and all flow rates. The presented approach is promising regarding fish community assessment and ecological river engineering. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Biological stoichiometry theory considers the balance of multiple chemical elements in living systems, whereas metabolic scaling theory considers how size affects metabolic properties from cells to ecosystems. We review recent developments integrating biological stoichiometry and metabolic scaling theories in the context of plant ecology and global change. Although vascular plants exhibit wide variation in foliar carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus ratios, they exhibit a higher degree of 'stoichiometric homeostasis' than previously appreciated. Thus, terrestrial carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus stoichiometry will reflect the effects of adjustment to local growth conditions as well as species' replacements. Plant stoichiometry exhibits size scaling, as foliar nutrient concentration decreases with increasing plant size, especially for phosphorus. Thus, small plants have lower nitrogen:phosphorus ratios. Furthermore, foliar nutrient concentration is reflected in other tissues (root, reproductive, support), permitting the development of empirical models of production that scale from tissue to whole-plant levels. Plant stoichiometry exhibits large-scale macroecological patterns, including stronger latitudinal trends and environmental correlations for phosphorus concentration (relative to nitrogen) and a positive correlation between nutrient concentrations and geographic range size. Given this emerging knowledge of how plant nutrients respond to environmental variables and are connected to size, the effects of global change factors (such as carbon dioxide, temperature, nitrogen deposition) can be better understood.},

The time of these movements was then related to a number of monitored and calculated environmental parameters. No eel movements were recorded in the winter months when mean stream temperature was below 10 degrees C. The numbers of movements peaked in May, when mean water temperatures and day length were increasing. The movement of eels was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001, R(2) = 0.45, N = 72) correlated with the time of sunset, with the majority (72{\%}) recorded during the hours of darkness. The results of this investigation have implications for the design/timing of surveys of yellow eel populations and their habitat associations and suggest that successfully determining the microhabitat preferences of active resident eels will require remote monitoring throughout the 24-h period.},

abstract = {Recently, the migratory history of temperate species of anguillid eels has been intensively studied using analytical microchemical techniques to determine the ratios of strontium to calcium (Sr:Ca) in the otoliths. However, there have been few studies of this nature on tropical anguillid eel species. To elucidate the migration ecology of the freshwater eel genus Anguilla, as well as its life history and habitat use, we examined the otolith Sr and Ca concentrations of a tropical anguillid eel Anguilla bicolor bicolor collected in Indonesian waters. In A. bicolor bicolor collected in a lagoon area, the change in Sr:Ca ratios outside the high Sr:Ca core showed two patterns of habitat use, (1) constantly living in either brackish or sea waters with no freshwater life (residents, 37{\%}), and (2) habitat shift from freshwater to brackish or sea waters (migrants, 63{\%}). For migrant fishes, most fish shifted their residence between 520 and 950 m (mean: 740 m) from the otolith core. These transitions suggest that these specimens moved to a higher salinity environment. The wide range of otolith Sr:Ca ratios (0.02 10-3 to 12.79 10-3 in all analytical points outside of 150 m from the core of all otoliths) in A. bicolor bicolor indicated that the habitat use of the tropical eel was facultative among fresh, brackish and marine waters during their growth phases after recruitment to the coastal areas. This flexible habitat use was the same as that of temperate eels. Thus, the migrations of anguillid eels into freshwater is clearly not an obligatory behavior. 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In response to declines in fishery-dependent data due to fishery closures, fishery-independent sampling of reef fish has become even more critical to stock assessment. Here we test whether a long-term chevron trapping survey could benefit from the addition of underwater video cameras. Sampling occurred on continental shelf and shelf break habitats (15-83. m deep) between northern Georgia and central Florida. Reef fish frequency of occurrence was significantly higher on video compared to traps for 11 of 15 species analyzed, and the increase ranged from 38{\%} to infinity for these 11 species. Frequency of occurrence for the four remaining species was not significantly different between traps and video. Although positive relationships were observed between log-transformed trap and video indices of abundance for five selected reef fish species, considerable amounts of unexplained variation existed and the relationship for three species was nonlinear. Underwater video can be a beneficial addition to a long-term trapping survey by increasing the frequency of occurrence for most reef fish species, which should translate into improved indices of reef fish abundance in the SUSLME. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Over the past four decades the establishment of pine plantations in high altitude p{\'{a}}ramo grasslands has been a growing land use change in Ecuador. As a result, plantation forestry has transformed some highland landscapes from grasslands to ones dominated by exotic trees. This transformation is analyzed in the context of forest transition theory, which provides a framework for explaining scenarios of increasing forest cover. Forest transition theory predicts that reforestation and afforestation, encompassing the establishment of secondary forests and plantations, respectively, occur when economic development leads to the abandonment of agricultural land or when forest scarcity prompts increases in plantation establishment. This research demonstrates that projected forest scarcity has played an important role in p{\'{a}}ramo to pine transitions. However, it also indicates that, in Ecuador, afforestation has been seen as a potential means to economic development rather than a consequence of it. Furthermore, this case brings into question some of the assumptions of forest transition theory with respect to the environmental benefits of transition. The evidence presented indicates that, in the case of p{\'{a}}ramo to pine transitions, the biophysical response includes a loss of soil carbon, nitrogen, and water retention capacity, implying important trade-offs between the ecosystem services provided by p{\'{a}}ramos and those provided by pine plantations.},

abstract = {A 3-yr (2003-2005) study was conducted to assess the effect of two tillage methods: conventional tillage (CT, with four ploughings using a traditional plough, maresha) and minimum tillage (MT, with a single pass prior to sowing) and of N-fertilization, on tef yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), weed infestation and soil properties at two locations in the rainfed semiarid conditions of Ethiopia. The experimental design was a split plot with three replications, with tillage treatments as main plots and N-rates as subplots. The N-fertilization rates were 0 kg N ha-1 (ZN), 30 kg N ha-1 (LN), 60 kg N ha-1 (MN) and 90 kg N ha-1 (HN). The minimum tillage practice produced as high yields as conventional tillage. Both total dry matter (DM) and grain yields were increased by N-fertilization. At both locations and in all years, there was a linear increase in dry matter production when N was increased from ZN to HN. The grain yield showed a similar increasing trend up to MN level but decreased from MN to HN. Available moisture content was relatively higher for minimum till (MT) than for conventional till (CT). In the dry years of the 2003 and 2004 cropping seasons, the average available moisture content in the plough layer was higher in MT than in CT by 0.004 m (2003) and 0.003 m (2004). Weed infestation was significantly higher in MT than in CT, with weed numbers 96 higher and weights 102 g m-2 higher in MT. Nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increased N but was not affected by tillage methods. Average N recoveries for CT and MT were generally similar (about 43{\%}). Nitrogen fertilization significantly affected the soil total N and C/N ratio at lower depth (0.15-0.30 m). Average total N at the lower depth increased by 35.2 kg ha-1 yr-1 (203{\%}) when N application rate was increased from MN to HN, suggesting that higher N levels are to be avoided to reduce excessive leaching to lower depths. Thus, the adoption of MT in the semiarid conditions could benefit soil and moisture conservations and reduce costs for resource poor farmers in Ethiopia without significantly affecting yield. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Nearly every aspect of the cloud forest is affected by regular cloud immersion, from the hydrological cycle to the species of plants and animals within the forest. Since the altitude band of cloud formation on tropical mountains is limited, the tropical montane cloud forest occurs in fragmented strips and has been likened to island archipelagoes. This isolation and uniqueness promotes explosive speciation, exceptionally high endemism, and a great sensitivity to climate. Global climate change threatens all ecosystems through temperature and rainfall changes, with a typical estimate for altitude shifts in the climatic optimum for mountain ecotones of hundreds of meters by the time of CO2 doubling. This alone suggests complete replacement of many of the narrow altitude range cloud forests by lower altitude ecosystems, as well as the expulsion of peak residing cloud forests into extinction. However, the cloud forest will also be affected by other climate changes, in particular changes in cloud formation. A number of global climate models suggest a reduction in low level cloudiness with the coming climate changes, and one site in particular, Monteverde, Costa Rica, appears to already be experiencing a reduction in cloud immersion. The coming climate changes appear very likely to upset the current dynamic equilibrium of the cloud forest. Results will include biodiversity loss, altitude shifts in species' ranges and subsequent community reshuffling, and possibly forest death. Difficulties for cloud forest species to survive in climate-induced migrations include no remaining location with a suitable climate, no pristine location to colonize, migration rates or establishment rates that cannot keep up with climate change rates and new species interactions. We review previous cloud forest species redistributions in the paleo-record in light of the coming changes. The characteristic epiphytes of the cloud forest play an important role in the light, hydrological and nutrient cycles of the cloud forest and are especially sensitive to atmospheric climate change, especially humidity, as the epiphytes can occupy incredibly small eco-niches from the canopy to crooks to trunks. Even slight shifts in climate can cause wilting or death to the epiphyte community. Similarly, recent cloud forest animal redistributions, notably frog and lizard disappearances, may be driven by climate changes. Death of animals or epiphytes may have cascading effects on the cloud forest web of life. Aside from changes in temperature, precipitation, and cloudiness, other climate changes may include increasing dry seasons, droughts, hurricanes and intense rain storms, all of which might increase damage to the cloud forest. Because cloud forest species occupy such small areas and tight ecological niches, they are not likely to colonize damaged regions. Fire, drought and plant invasions (especially non-native plants) are likely to increase the effects of any climate change damage in the cloud forest. As has frequently been suggested in the literature, all of the above factors combine to make the cloud forest a likely site for observing climate change effects in the near future.

One of the crucial steps in evaluating the impact of invasive species is to map changes in their actual and potential distribution and relative abundance across a wide region over an appropriate time span. While direct and indirect remote sensing approaches have long been used to assess the invasion of plant species, the distribution of invasive animals is mainly based on indirect methods that rely on environmental proxies of conditions suitable for colonization by a particular species. The aim of this article is to review recent efforts in the predictive modelling of the spread of both plant and animal invasive species using remote sensing, and to stimulate debate on the potential use of remote sensing in biological invasion monitoring and forecasting. Specifically, the challenges and drawbacks of remote sensing techniques are discussed in relation to: i) developing species distribution models, and ii) studying life cycle changes and phenological variations. Finally, the paper addresses the open challenges and pitfalls of remote sensing for biological invasion studies including sensor characteristics, upscaling and downscaling in species distribution models, and uncertainty of results.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal in animal ecology is to quantify how environmental (and other) factors influence individual movement, as this is key to understanding responsiveness of populations to future change. However, quantitative interpretation of individual-based telemetry data is hampered by the complexity of, and error within, these multi-dimensional data. Here, we present an integrative hierarchical Bayesian state-space modelling approach where, for the first time, the mechanistic process model for the movement state of animals directly incorporates both environmental and other behavioural information, and observation and process model parameters are estimated within a single model. When applied to a migratory marine predator, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), we find the switch from directed to resident movement state was associated with colder water temperatures, relatively short dive bottom time and rapid descent rates. The approach presented here can have widespread utility for quantifying movement-behaviour (diving or other)-environment relationships across species and systems.},

abstract = {The tropical Andes in Ecuador and Colombia are a biodiversity hotspot that has endured centuries of forest clearance and degradation. Forest restoration has been identified as a regional conservation priority; in recent decades, native species reforestation projects have proliferated, but little information exists on growth performance of commonly planted tree species in relation to site and soil nutrient status. This study analyzed growth of seven common native species (Alnus acuminata, Baccharis bogotensis, Cedrela montana, Myrica pubesens, Quercus humboltii, Sambucus nigra, Smallanthus pyramidalis) on 12 montane forest sites across the northern region of the tropical Andes. Andean alder (A. acuminata) was the most commonly planted species, and grows at a mean annual diameter increment (MAI-d) of 1.81 cm y−1 and a mean annual height increment (MAI-h) of 0.95 m y−1. S. pyramidalis, a short lived pioneer of the Asteraceae family, also exhibited fast growth rates of 1.64 cm MAI-d and 1.21 m MAI-h. Andean oak (Q. humboltii) was the second-most commonly planted species, growing with an MAI-d of 0.99 cm and MAI-h of 0.56 m. Soil magnesium and potassium were significant predictors of MAI-d and MAI-h for A. acuminata, while soil nitrogen, phosphorous, sodium, and calcium were negatively associated with growth (p {\textless} .001). We speculate that A. acuminata did not grow as well on soils richer in calcium and phosphorus because they were less conducive to nitrogen symbiosis common to this species. Soil magnesium and calcium were significant predictors (p {\textless} .05) of diameter growth for Q. humboltii. For both species, we attribute growth responses to soil nutrients as a result of the variable nature of fertility in the complex and variable soils that make up the volcanic and surficial geological landscape of the northern Andes. Results indicate that native species can grow in a variety of soil conditions, and exhibit growth rates comparable to non-native species. However, our results suggest native species are site restricted for best growth and should be planted on particular soils. We make recommendations for reforestation for the species in this study.},

abstract = {Much of ecological research centers around discovering the underlying factors for species distribution; three such factors are of central importance: local environment, landscape features and dispersal. While all have been simplified in the past, the recent increase in metapopulation and metacommunity research makes being able to quantify dispersal all that much more necessary. In order to increase our knowledge about metacommunities in the “real word”, it is clearly time to start thinking critically about whether and how the methods that are currently available for measuring dispersal within metapopulations can be adapted. The goal of this contribution is to present and argue the technical difficulties involved in measuring dispersal within metacommunities through: (1) discussing the merits and pitfalls of some potential direct (e.g., mark-recapture) and indirect methods (e.g., isolation measures, patchiness) for studying the effects of dispersal at the metapopulation and metacommunity level; (2) discuss the types of questions that can be tackled at the metacommunity level in light of methodological decisions; and (3) make the point that the technical difficulties of measuring dispersal for multiple species may leave us with little other options than using indirect methods to estimate dispersal in metacommunities},

abstract = {To study the migratory behaviour in wild northern European silver eel Anguilla anguilla during sea entry and early marine migration, 32 individuals were tagged with acoustic transmitters and registered at four automatic listening station arrays from the mouth of the north Norwegian River Alta and throughout the Alta Fjord. The A. anguilla entered the fjord during all parts of the tidal cycle and did not seem to utilize the outgoing tidal currents. They migrated mainly during the night, in both the river mouth and the fjord. On average, they spent 2{\textperiodcentered}7 days travelling from the river mouth to the outermost array, 31 km from the river mouth, corresponding to an average migratory speed of 0{\textperiodcentered}5 km h(-1) . The A. anguilla generally migrated in the central part of the fjord and in the uppermost 10-25{\%} of the water column, but with frequent dives to greater depths. Already 4 km after sea entry, A. anguilla were observed diving deeper than 130 m within 20-30 min periods. Hence, this study demonstrated that A. anguilla may perform an active diving behaviour during the early marine migration. The study took place in a pristine area with a minimum of anthropogenic interventions and by individuals from a population still uninfected by the introduced parasite Anguillicoloides crassus. The results may therefore be used as a baseline for future studies of the A. anguilla early marine migration.},

abstract = {The European eel stock has long been in decline. Consequently, the species has been added to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. One threat that has been identified as one possibly having an impact on the stock is mortality caused by hydroelectric power plant turbines. Turbine management, which is adapted to preferable migration conditions, might reduce the risk of this threat. Our study, conducted at five locations in southern Sweden, aimed at learning about the migratory behaviour of European silver eels paying special attention to preferable environmental conditions for migration by using advanced statistical modelling. Results indicated that downstream migration triggers can be reliably described using hydrological variables (discharge, precipitation or one of their dynamic derivations), water temperature and moon. Spring and autumn migrations seemed to be triggered differently. In spring, rising water temperatures seemed to be the key trigger, quite independently of hydrological variables and the moon. In the autumn, the importance of the moon and hydrological variables on downstream migration increased. In addition, migration triggers differed depending upon the size of the body of water and/or its location in the river system. In smaller/upstream tributaries, hydrological variables seemed to be the key trigger. In larger/downstream waters, the importance of water temperature and the moon increased. The transferability of models was limited. Moreover, models indicated that in some cases, the dynamics of water temperature and hydrological variables (precipitation, discharge) provided more explanatory power than the measured, absolute values. Transferability among time series from the same location delivered some reliable results. Success of transferability between locations was limited to sites which originated from the same river catchment. In spring, migration activity did not occur until water temperatures exceeded 6.5 °C in a tributary and 9 °C in the K{\"{a}}vlinge{\aa}n River. Eels showed significant nocturnal migration behaviour (98.5 {\%}; n = 205) and migration activity became very unlikely in autumn if water temperatures dropped below 5 °C. Our data on spring migration is limited to one site in a tributary and one site in a lower mainstream. Furthermore, spatial transferability among catchments has not been tested in previous studies. Therefore, we recommend that future studies be performed during the spring and autumn migrations in tributaries as well as lower mainstreams. Moreover, previous studies indicate that some eels hesitate for several days or even reverse upstream instead of entering the traps the same night that they arrive. Additional visual techniques such as hydroacoustic cameras should be applied upstream of catch facilities in order monitor eel migration activity of unharmed eels. This enables the validation of trap catchability and consequently the response of our models. Our results clearly show that turbine induced mortality could be minimized if turbine operation focuses on daytime periods, when water temperature is below 5 ° C and when the discharge not is stable or decreasing. Moreover, local adaptive turbine management should be accompanied by studies to determine the local constellation of environmental triggers. In addition, it will be crucial, that later applications (e.g. turbine management, early warning systems etc.) consider the temporal dynamic of water temperature and hydrological variables.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTWe contrasted the structure and biomass of four lowland Neotropical forests (La Selva, Costa Rica; Barro Colorado Island, Panama; Cocha Cashu, Peru; and KM41, Brazil) to determine if commonalities exist within and among forests differing in latitude, rainfall, seasonality, and soil fertility. We examined the effect of soil fertility specifically by measuring the density and basal area of trees, lianas, and palms on two soil types differing in fertility at each site. We used allometric relationships to estimate the contribution of the various life-forms to total aboveground biomass (AGB) and compared two relationships for trees 30 cm diameter or greater. Estimated liana density and AGB were similar among sites, but the density and AGB of trees and palms, estimated using diameter alone, differed significantly. Basal area and AGB of trees 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) or greater differed among forests and averaged 30.2 m2/ha and 250 Mg/ha, respectively. Cocha Cashu and KM41 had higher tree basal area and AGB than La Selva or Barro Colorado Island. Across forests, lianas and small trees (1–10 cm DBH) each contributed between 4 and 5 percent of the total AGB and small palms contributed ca 1 percent. Many forest inventories ignore lianas, as well as trees and palms less than 10 cm DBH, and therefore underestimate AGB by ca 10 percent. Soil type had little influence on the forest structure within sites, except at Cocha Cashu where total AGB was much higher and liana density much lower on the more fertile old floodplain Entisols than the serra firme Oxisols. Although total stem density, basal area, and some biomass components differed significantly among forests, they seemed less variable than other quantitative measures (e.g., species richness).RESUMENContrastamos la estructura y la biomasa de cuatro bosques de bajura Neotropicales (La Selva, Costa Rica; Isla Barro Colorado, Panam{\'{a}}; Cocha Cashu, Per{\'{u}}; y KM41, Brasil) para determinar si existen patrones comunes entre bosques que difieren en la latitud, en la lluvia total, en la estacionalidad, y en la fertilidad de suelo.

abstract = {Uncertainties in the rate of biomass variation with forest ageing in tropical secondary forests, particularly in belowground components, limit the accuracy of carbon pool estimates in tropical regions. We monitored changes in above- and belowground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and biomass allocation to the leaf component to determine the variation in carbon accumulation rate with forest age after shifting cultivation in Sarawak, Malaysia. Nine plots in a 4-year-old forest and fourteen plots in a 10-year-old forest were monitored for 5 and 7 years, respectively. Forest and plant part biomass were calculated from an allometric equation obtained from the same forest stands. Both above- and belowground biomass increased rapidly during the initial decade after abandonment. In contrast, a much slower rate of biomass accumulation was observed after the initial decade. LAI also increased by approximately double from the 4-year-old to 10-year-old forest, and then gently increased to the 17-year-old forest. We also found that allocation variation in leaf biomass and nitrogen was closely related to the rate of biomass accumulation as a forest aged. During the first decade after abandonment, a high biomass and nitrogen allocation to the leaf component may have allowed for a high rate of biomass accumulation. However, reduction in those allocations to leaf component after the initial decade may have helped to suppress the biomass accumulation rate in older secondary forests. Roots accounted for 14.0–16.1{\%} of total biomass in the 4–17-year-old abandoned secondary forests. We also verified the model predicted values for belowground biomass by Cairns et al. (1997) and Mokany et al. (2006), although both models overestimated the values throughout our data sets by 45–50{\%} in the 10-year-old forest. The low root:shoot ratio in the secondary forests may have caused this overestimation. Therefore, our results suggest that we should modify the models to estimate belowground biomass considering the low root:shoot ratio in tropical secondary forests.},

abstract = {The low average grain yield (0.7 ton ha−1) of tef in Ethiopia is mainly attributed to low soil fertility, and inappropriate tillage and weeds control practices. Despite this, limited scientific information has been documented so far on their interaction effects on tef crop productivity in northern Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to assess the separate and interaction effects of tillage, fertilizer, and weed control practices on tef yield and yield components in the conditions of northern Ethiopia. A two-year study (2008-2009) was conducted using split-split-plot design with three replications. In the main plot, three tillage treatments: conventional tillage (6 times tillage passes) (T1), four times tillage passes (T2), and reduced tillage (single tillage pass at sowing) (T3) were applied. The fertilizer treatments in the subplots were: no fertilizer (F1); 23 kg N ha−1 (F2); 23 kg N ha−1 and 10 kg P ha−1 (F3); 23 kg N ha−1 and 2.5 ton manure ha−1 (F4); and 2.5 ton manure ha−1 (F5). The sub-subplot weed control treatments included farmer weed control practice or hand weeding (W1); 2,4 D at 0.75 kg ha−1 at five-leaf stage; 2,4 D at 0.75 kg ha−1 at six-leaf stage; 2,4 D at 1.5 kg ha−1 at five-leaf stage; and 2,4 D at 1.5 kg ha−1 at six-leaf stage. This study showed that the separate and interaction effects of tillage, fertilizer, and weed control practices significantly affected tef crop yield and yield components in both crop seasons. T2 increased tef yield by {\textgreater}42{\%} over the other tillage and F3 increased yield by {\textgreater}21{\%} over the other fertilizer treatments. Grain yield increased by {\textgreater}23{\%} due to W1. This study thus suggested that promising treatments such as T2, F3, and W1 should be demonstrated at on-farm fields in order to evaluate their performance at farmers' conditions.},

This study investigated the estuarine migration of female silver eels in the Loire River using an acoustic telemetry system. An array of 31 hydrophones was deployed in the Loire estuary and 51 female seaward migrants were tagged with acoustic transmitters and released 20km upstream of the estuary, at 100km from the river mouth. 94{\%} of the silver eels could be followed down to the river mouth. Mean global estuarine speed was 4.5 km days-1, i.e., 0.05 m s-1 and residence times varied significantly between upstream and lower compartments. Mean directional migration speed was found to be 48.6 km days-1, i.e., 0.56 m s-1, and appeared correlated with total length and body weight. Also, daily escapement rate was highly influenced by river flow.},

As such, these data conform to the pattern of "reverse diversity" for myxomycetes in the neotropics, with higher diversity for less mesic forest types than for more mesic forest types. Canonical correspondence analysis of myxomycete abundances in relation to microhabitat parameters revealed three major ecological assemblages: wood-, litter- and inflorescence-inhabiting species. All three assemblages include a number of specialized species, with the assemblage associated with litter being the most diverse and the one associated with inflorescences being the most distinctive. In addition, samples from the microhabitat represented by the cover of epiphyllic liverworts on living leaves regularly produce myxomycetes in moist chamber culture but with few sporocarps and no evidence of any specialized species. At least near ground level, bark-inhabiting (corticolous) myxomycetes are uncommon in the cloud forests sampled in the present study.},

abstract = {A generalization of a class of differential length-scale equations typically used in second-order turbulence models for oceanic flows is suggested. Commonly used models, like the k- model and the Mellor-Yamada model, can be recovered as special cases of this generic model, and thus can be rationally compared. In addition, a method is proposed that yields a generalized framework for the calibration of the most frequently used class of differential length-scale equations. The generic model, calibrated with this method, exhibits a greater range of applicability than any of the traditional models. Stratified flows, plane mixing layers, and turbulence introduced by breaking surface waves are considered besides some classical test cases.},

abstract = {Numerical modeling of flow dynamics in river channels may require the spatial interpolation of scattered measurements of bathymetry elevation to obtain elevations at computational mesh nodes. This paper examines the various spatial interpolation methods used in interpolating river channel bathymetry. Commonly used interpolation methods, namely inverse distance weighting, spline (tension and regularized), natural neighbor, TopoGrid, and ordinary kriging (isotropic and anisotropic) are evaluated within the ArcGIS environment by using root mean square error (RMSE) criteria. To study the anisotropic effects, the interpolation methods are evaluated in two different coordinate systems: a Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system and a flow-oriented (s, n) coordinate system. Using the data from the Brazos River in Texas, it is shown that TopoGrid, natural neighbor and ordinary kriging, which do not account of anisotropy in the data, performed better than anisotropic kriging in the Cartesian coordinate system. In the flow-oriented coordinate system, the performance of anisotropic spatial interpolation methods is significantly better (40{\%} reduction in RMSE) compared to the isotropic interpolation methods. A modified version of inverse distance weighting method, called elliptical inverse distance weighting (EIDW), is developed to account for river anisotropy. The RMSE results from application of EIDW are close to that from anisotropic kriging, thus providing a simple and computationally faster alternative to complex kriging methods. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Hedley fractionation recognizes plant-available forms (Resin Pi, Bicarb Pi, and Bicarb Po) and refractory forms (NaOH Pi, NaOH Po, sonic Pi, sonic Po, HCl Pi, Residual P) of soil phosphorus. This updated survey of the recent literature shows that the sequential fractionation proposed by Hedley et al. can also be used to separate forms of organically bound soil phosphorus from the geochemically bound fractions. We consider that biological P includes all the extracted organic fractions (Bicarb Po, NaOH o, sonic Po) and geochemical P includes the remaining fractions (Resin Pi, Bicarb Pi, NaOH Pi, sonic Pi, HCl Pi) and the Po and Pi in the Residual fraction. Data from the Hedley fractionation suggest that the contribution of geochemical versus biological processes to soil phosphorus availability varies with pedogenesis. The pool of primary phosphate declines and the NaOH and sonicated-NaOH phosphorus fractions increase as phosphorus becomes geochemically fixed to the iron and aluminum oxides in more highly weathered soils. The sum of organic-P fractions — biological P — is an increasing proportion of total available P as a function of soil development. Therefore, the Hedley fractionation provides a valuable index of the relative importance of biological processes to soil phosphorus content across a soil weathering gradient.},

Counts of the maximum number seen in any one field of view were used to estimate relative abundance of 347 spe- cies of bony fishes, cartilaginous fishes and sea snakes. Boosted regression trees were used to assess the influence of depth and location of sampling sites on species richness. Multivariate regression trees and indices of specificity and fidelity (Dufr{\^{e}}ne-Legendre indices) were used to distinguish 17 spatially contiguous vertebrate groups within a hierarchy of spatial scales. Location across the shelf and depth had the greatest influence on species richness, with peaks occurring around the {\~{}}35 m iso- bath in the inter-reef waters of the reef matrix, coinciding with shallow banks and shoals. Richness increased slightly toward the equator. Nine terminal vertebrate communities parallel to the coast were distinguished inshore and offshore in deep and shallow water along a latitudinal gradient. There were important community boundaries at Bowen in the south, Townsville in the centre, and Cape Flattery in the north. Latitudinal groupings were most evident inshore. Offshore communities were spatially extensive and separated lagoonal, mid-shelf and outer-shelf sites. Community bound- aries were correlated with knowledge of strong gradients in sedimentary and oceanographic pro- cesses influenced by the shape of the reef matrix and regional tides and currents.},

abstract = {Airborne remote sensing methods are needed to assess spatial patterns of stream temperature at scales relevant to issues in water quality and fisheries management. In this study, we developed an airborne remote sensing method to measure spatially continuous patterns of stream temperature and evaluated the physical factors that influence the accuracy of thermal remote sensing of flowing waters. The airborne thermal infrared (TIR) system incorporated an internally calibrated thermal imager (8-12 ??m) aligned with a visible band camera in a vertically mounted, gimbaled pod attached to the underside of a helicopter. High-resolution imagery (0.2-0.4 m) covering the entire channel and adjacent floodplains was recorded digitally and georeferenced in-flight along 50- to 60-km river sections ranging from 2 to 110 m in width. Radiant water temperature corresponded to kinetic water temperature (5-27??C) in a range of stream environments within ??0.5??C. Longitudinal profiles of radiant water temperature from downstream to headwater reaches provided a spatial context for assessing large-scale patterns of thermal heterogeneity and fine-scale thermal features such as tributaries and groundwater inputs. Potential sources of error in remote measurements of stream temperature included reflected longwave radiation, thermal boundary layer effects at the water surface, and vertical thermal stratification. After taking into account the radiative properties of the surrounding environment and the physical qualities of the stream, thermal remote sensing proved highly effective for examining spatial patterns of stream temperature at a resolution and extent previously unattainable through conventional methods of stream temperature measurement using in-stream data recorders. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

These data were used to determine the relation with river characteristics using negative binomial regression. At least five feeding habit modalities were associated with conductivity, velocity, pH, temperature, ammonium-N concentrations, and sediment. The various methods of estimating trait abundance differ in determined major patterns and ecological implications. Therefore, the estimation method used should be explicitly described in trait-related papers to avoid misinterpretation. Trait abundance-environment relationships can be linear or non-linear and therefore a careful selection of the functional relationship should be performed. The process of extracting knowledge from data is of paramount importance as relevant ecological insights were extracted providing insights on flow, wastewater and nutrient management in the rivers.},

abstract = {State-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) are known for their ability to explore the combined effects of multiple disturbances, ecological dynamics, and management actions on vegetation. However, integrating the additional impacts of climate change into STSMs remains a challenge. We address this challenge by combining an STSM with species distribution modeling (SDM). SDMs estimate the probability of occurrence of a given species based on observed presence and absence locations as well as environmental and climatic covariates. Thus, in order to account for changes in habitat suitability due to climate change, we used SDM to generate continuous surfaces of species occurrence probabilities. These data were imported into ST-Sim, an STSM platform, where they dictated the probability of each cell transitioning between alternate potential vegetation types at each time step. The STSM was parameterized to capture additional processes of vegetation growth and disturbance that are relevant to a keystone species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem—whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). We compared historical model runs against historical observations of whitebark pine and a key disturbance agent (mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae), and then projected the simulation into the future. Using this combination of correlative and stochastic simulation models, we were able to reproduce historical observations and identify key data gaps. Results indicated that SDMs and STSMs are complementary tools, and combining them is an effective way to account for the anticipated impacts of climate change, biotic interactions, and disturbances, while also allowing for the exploration of management options.},

abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ! 5 cm. diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5{\%} when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

To evaluate the effectiveness of these protected areas, observational techniques are used to determine densities, sizes, biomass, habitat types and distribution of fish species in and around management areas. Two types of observational techniques are used in spatial monitoring: (1) fishery-independent techniques, which include underwater visual census (UVC), underwater video, remote sensing, acoustics, and experimental catch and effort data; and (2) fishery-dependent techniques, which include catch, effort and catch per unit effort data from commercial and recreational fisheries. This review summarises the applications, advantages, disadvantages and biases of each of these observational categories and highlights emerging technologies. The main finding from this review was that a combination of observational techniques, rather than a single method, was the most effective approach to marine spatial monitoring. For example, a combination of hydroacoustics for habitat mapping and UVC or video for fish surveys was one of the most cost-effective and efficient means of obtaining fish-habitat linkages and fish assemblage data. There are also emerging technologies that could increase the precision and efficiency of monitoring surveys. There is a need for continued development of non-intrusive technology for marine monitoring studies.},

abstract = {Mangroves can capture and store organic carbon and their protection and therefore their restoration is a component of climate change mitigation. However, there are few empirical measurements of long-term carbon storage in mangroves or of how storage varies across environmental gradients. The context dependency of this process combined with geographically limited field sampling has made it difficult to generalize regional and global rates of mangrove carbon sequestration. This has in turn hampered the inclusion of sequestration by mangroves in carbon cycle models and in carbon offset markets. The purpose of this study was to estimate the relative carbon capture and storage potential in natural and restored mangrove forests. We measured depth profiles of soil organic carbon content in 72 cores collected from six sites (three natural, two restored, and one afforested) surrounding Muisne, Ecuador. Samples up to 1 m deep were analyzed for organic matter content using loss-on-ignition and values were converted to organic carbon content using an accepted ratio of 1.72 (g/g). Results suggest that average soil carbon storage is 0.055 ± 0.002 g cm(-3) (11.3 ± 0.8{\%} carbon content by dry mass, mean ± 1 SE) up to 1 m deep in natural sites, and 0.058 ± 0.002 g cm(-3) (8.0 ± 0.3{\%}) in restored sites. These estimates are concordant with published global averages. Evidence of equivalent carbon stocks in restored and afforested mangrove patches emphasizes the carbon sink potential for reestablished mangrove systems. We found no relationship between sediment carbon storage and aboveground biomass, forest structure, or within-patch location. Our results demonstrate the long-term carbon storage potential of natural mangroves, high effectiveness of mangrove restoration and afforestation, a lack of predictability in carbon storage strictly based on aboveground parameters, and the need to establish standardized protocol for quantifying mangrove sediment carbon stocks.},

abstract = {Using the concepts of the Constituent-oriented Age and Residence time Theory (CART), we compute timescales related to the water renewal in the Scheldt Estuary (The Netherlands/Belgium). Three different timescales are used to better understand and characterize the dynamics of the estuary: the age of the renewing water, the residence time and the exposure time. The residence time is the time taken by a water parcel to leave the estuary for the first time while the exposure time is the total time spent by a water parcel in the estuary including re-entries. The age of a renewing water parcel is defined as the time elapsed since it entered the estuary. The renewing water was split into three types: the water originating from the sea, the water originating from the upstream fresh tidal rivers and the water originating from the different canals and docks connected to the estuary. Every timescale is computed at any time and position by means of the finite-element, unstructured-mesh model SLIM. This results in movies of the timescale fields (shown as Supplementary material), allowing a detailed analysis of their spatial and temporal variabilities. The effect of the M2 tide and the discharge regime (winter, summer or average situation) on the timescales is also investigated. Tidally-averaged timescales vary little over the width of the estuary and hence exhibit a virtually one-dimensional behaviour. However, around these average values, the timescales can vary hugely over a tidal cycle, with amplitudes that significantly depend on the space coordinates. The reason thereof has yet to be elucidated. These results underscore the need for two- or three-dimensional models with high temporal resolution for investigating the dynamics of the Scheldt Estuary. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Most models still largely ignore or inappropriately take into account important features of species' distributions, such as spatial autocorrelation, dispersal and migration, biotic and environmental interactions. Whether distributions of natural communities or ecosystems are better modelled by assembling individual species' predictions in a bottom-up approach or modelled as collective entities is another important issue. An international workshop was organized to address these issues. 3. We discuss more specifically six issues in a methodological framework for generalized regression: (i) links with ecological theory; (ii) optimal use of existing data and artificially generated data; (iii) incorporating spatial context; (iv) integrating ecological and environmental interactions; (v) assessing prediction errors and uncertainties; and (vi) predicting distributions of communities or collective properties of biodiversity. 4. Synthesis and applications. Better predictions of the effects of impacts on biological communities and ecosystems can emerge only from more robust species' distribution models and better documentation of the uncertainty associated with these models. An improved understanding of causes of species' distributions, especially at their range limits, as well as of ecological assembly rules and ecosystem functioning, is necessary if further progress is to be made. A better collaborative effort between theoretical and functional ecologists, ecological modellers and statisticians is required to reach these goals.},

abstract = {Ecosystems across the biosphere are subject to rapid changes in elemental balance and climatic regimes. A major force structuring ecological responses to these perturbations lies in the stoichiometric flexibility of systems - the ability to adjust their elemental balance whilst maintaining function. The potential for stoichiometric flexibility underscores the utility of the application of a framework highlighting the constraints and consequences of elemental mass balance and energy cycling in biological systems to address global change phenomena. Improvement in the modeling of ecological responses to disturbance requires the consideration of the stoichiometric flexibility of systems within and across relevant scales. Although a multitude of global change studies over various spatial and temporal scales exist, the explicit consideration of the role played by stoichiometric flexibility in linking micro-scale to macro-scale biogeochemical processes in terrestrial ecosystems remains relatively unexplored. Focusing on terrestrial systems under change, we discuss the mechanisms by which stoichiometric flexibility might be expressed and connected from organisms to ecosystems. We suggest that the transition from the expression of stoichiometric flexibility within individuals to the community and ecosystem scales is a key mechanism regulating the extent to which environmental perturbation may alter ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling dynamics.},

abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) is being rapidly adopted as a tool to detect rare animals. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) using probe-based chemistries may represent a particularly powerful tool because of the method's sensitivity, specificity, and potential to quantify target DNA. However, there has been little work understanding the performance of these assays in the presence of closely related, sympatric taxa. If related species cause any cross-amplification or interference, false positives and negatives may be generated. These errors can be disastrous if false positives lead to overestimate the abundance of an endangered species or if false negatives prevent detection of an invasive species. In this study we test factors that influence the specificity and sensitivity of TaqMan MGB assays using co-occurring, closely related brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and bull trout (S. confluentus) as a case study. We found qPCR to be substantially more sensitive than traditional PCR, with a high probability of detection at concentrations as low as 0.5 target copies/µl. We also found that number and placement of base pair mismatches between the Taqman MGB assay and non-target templates was important to target specificity, and that specificity was most influenced by base pair mismatches in the primers, rather than in the probe. We found that insufficient specificity can result in both false positive and false negative results, particularly in the presence of abundant related species. Our results highlight the utility of qPCR as a highly sensitive eDNA tool, and underscore the importance of careful assay design.},

abstract = {Using the concepts of the Constituent-oriented Age and Residence time Theory (CART), we compute timescales related to the water renewal in the Scheldt Estuary (The Netherlands/Belgium). Three different timescales are used to better understand and characterize the dynamics of the estuary: the age of the renewing water, the residence time and the exposure time. The residence time is the time taken by a water parcel to leave the estuary for the first time while the exposure time is the total time spent by a water parcel in the estuary including re-entries. The age of a renewing water parcel is defined as the time elapsed since it entered the estuary. The renewing water was split into three types: the water originating from the sea, the water originating from the upstream fresh tidal rivers and the water originating from the different canals and docks connected to the estuary. Every timescale is computed at any time and position by means of the finite-element, unstructured-mesh model SLIM. This results in movies of the timescale fields (shown as Supplementary material), allowing a detailed analysis of their spatial and temporal variabilities. The effect of the M2 tide and the discharge regime (winter, summer or average situation) on the timescales is also investigated. Tidally-averaged timescales vary little over the width of the estuary and hence exhibit a virtually one-dimensional behaviour. However, around these average values, the timescales can vary hugely over a tidal cycle, with amplitudes that significantly depend on the space coordinates. The reason thereof has yet to be elucidated. These results underscore the need for two- or three-dimensional models with high temporal resolution for investigating the dynamics of the Scheldt Estuary. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aim Our scientific understanding of the extent and distribution of mangrove forests of the world is inadequate. The available global mangrove databases, com- piled using disparate geospatial data sources and national statistics, need to be improved.Here,we mapped the status and distributions of global mangroves using recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat archive. Methods We interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes using hybrid super- vised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. Each image was normalized for variation in solar angle and earth–sun distance by converting the digital number values to the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance.Ground truth data and existing maps and databases were used to select training samples and also for iterative labelling. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the published literature to map ‘true mangroves'. Results The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 75{\%} of world's mangroves are found in just 15 countries, and only 6.9{\%} are protected under the existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves is generally confined to the tropical and subtropical regions and the largest percentage of mangroves is found between 5° N and 5° S latitude. Main conclusions We report that the remaining area of mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought. Our estimate is 12.3{\%} smaller than the most recent estimate by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.We present the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest resolution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created.We developed and used better mapping techniques and data sources and mapped mangroves with better spatial and thematic details than previous studies.},

Downed wood was separated into fine ({\textless} 10 cm in diameter) and coarse (≥ 10 cm in diameter) classes, and three decomposition states (sound, intermediate, or rotten). The total quantity of dead wood, averaged by life zone, was lowest in the dry (2.43 Mg/ha), reached a peak in the moist (42.33 Mg/ha) and decreased slightly in the wet (34.50 Mg/ha) life zone. Most of the dead wood was in the standing dead category (about 42–76{\%} of the total). The decomposition state of dead wood in all plots was mostly rotten (45{\%}) or intermediate (44{\%}); there was little sound wood (11{\%}). Turnover rates of dead wood generally ranged between 0.03/yr to 0.52/yr with no clear trend with life zone. The large amount of dead wood in some plots was equivalent to about 20 percent or less of aboveground biomass, indicating that dead wood can represent a significant amount of carbon in these forests.},

abstract = {Cloud-water and rainfall interception are hydrological processes of particular interest in Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCF). Studies in these systems have shown important contributions of cloud/fog water to the hydrological balance. To evaluate the importance of cloud/fog water to montane forests of the western slope of the Cordillera Yanachaga in the eastern Andes of central Peru, we monitored bulk precipitation (gross rainfall), cloud water and net precipitation weekly over one year at two elevations, 2468 and 2815 masl. Bulk precipitation was greater at the upper site (2753 mm) than at the lower site (2222 mm). Annual net precipitation was 92.4{\%} and 70.4{\%} of rainfall at the upper and lower sites, respectively. Net precipitation was primarily composed of throughfall; stemflow was negligible, contributing less than 0.2{\%} of annual rainfall at both sites. Apparent annual rainfall interception losses by the canopy were 7.7{\%} and 29.6{\%} of the bulk precipitation at the upper and lower sites, respectively. Apparent weekly rainfall interception at the upper site was sometimes negative and lower compared to that of the lower site. Apparent cloud-water interception occurred at least during weeks when negative rainfall interception was recorded, a contribution of 21 mm (0.8{\%} of the annual rainfall) at the upper site. However, the apparent low rainfall interception losses at the upper site suggest that canopy wetting and subsequent saturation by cloud/fog water during periods with apparent positive rainfall interception may have contributed a difference of ca. 22{\%} of apparent rainfall interception losses between sites. These contributions were supported by maximum apparent fog interception recorded by a fog gauge at the upper site. Although other equally important factors like topography, crown exposure and mossiness were not evaluated, the quantity of apparent fog interception at the upper site was found related to the canopy leaf area index. This important relationship has been previously described but mostly overlooked in studies of TMCF. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The following examines the evolutionary ecology of wood density using a large database for seed plants. In particular, we focused on the geographic and phylogenetic variation in wood density for both gymnosperms and angiosperms. A phylogenetic supertree was constructed for over 4600 taxa, allowing for comprehensive analyses of divergences across the seed plant phylogeny. Community-wide means and variances for wood densities were quantified for 171 standardized forest communities. Wood density was generally highly conserved across the entire seed plant phylogeny, yet large divergences were found within the rosid clade. Geographic and community variation in wood density, however, was significantly lower in temperate and high elevation communities, dominated by gymnosperms, than in tropical lowland communities, dominated by angiosperms, suggesting an increase in trait and, to some extent, clade filtering with latitude and elevation. Together, our results support the notion that both biotic and abiotic forces have been important in the evolution of wood density as well as in controlling the observed trait mean and variance across geographic gradients.},

Elevation, annual precipitation, parent material, and dominant species were nearly constant along this gradient. Foliar N and P concentrations in Metrosideros were lowest in the youngest site (0.72{\%} and 0.052{\%} for N and P, respectively), increased to a maximum on 20 X 10(3) and 150 X 10(3)-yr-old substrates (1.45{\%} and 0.108{\%}), and then declined close to the initial concentrations in the oldest site (0.86{\%} and 0.061{\%}); N:P ratios in foliage varied relatively little across the sites. Most other species followed a similar pattern of variation. On a per unit leaf area basis, foliar N and P contents in Metrosideros also peaked on intermediate-aged substrate. Foliar nutrient concentrations in Metrosideros sun leaves were determined across a parallel but wetter substrate age gradient. The pattern of variation was similar on both gradients, but the magnitude of variation was smaller on the wetter sequence of sites. Overall, the pattern of variation in foliar nutrients with substrate age is consistent with conceptual models for the dynamics of soil nutrient availability during long-term soil development, and with measurements of soil properties along this sequence.},

abstract = {Recent overviews have suggested that the relationship between species richness and productivity (rate of conversion of resources to biomass per unit area per unit time) is unimodal (hump-shaped). Most agree that productivity affects species richness at large scales, but unanimity is less regarding underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have examined the possibility that variation in species richness within com- munities may influence productivity, leading to an exploration of the relative effect of alterations in species number per se as contrasted to the addition of productive species. Reviews of the literature concerning deserts, boreal forests, tropical forests, lakes, and wetlands lead to the conclusion that extant data are insufficient to conclusively resolve the relationship between diversity and productivity, or that patterns are variable with mechanisms equally varied and complex.Amore comprehensive survey of the ecologi- cal literatureuncovered approximately200relationships, ofwhich30{\%}wereunimodal, 26{\%} were positive linear, 12{\%} were negative linear, and 32{\%} were not significant. Categorization of studies with respect to geographic extent, ecological extent, taxo- nomic hierarchy, or energetic basis of productivity similarly yielded a heterogeneous distribution of relationships. Theoretical and empirical approaches increasingly sug- gest scale-dependence in the relationship between species richness and productivity; consequently, synthetic understanding may be contingent on explicit considerations of scale in analytical studies of productivity and diversity},

abstract = {Geostatistical models are typically based on symmetric straight-line distance, which fails to represent the spatial configuration, connectivity, directionality, and relative position of sites in a stream network. Freshwater ecologists have explored spatial patterns in stream networks using hydrologic distance measures and new geostatistical methodologies have recently been developed that enable directional hydrologic distance measures to be considered. The purpose of this study was to quantify patterns of spatial correlation in stream water chemistry using three distance measures: straight-line distance, symmetric hydrologic distance, and weighted asymmetric hydrologic distance. We used a dataset collected in Maryland, USA to develop both general linear models and geostatistical models (based on the three distance measures) for acid neutralizing capacity, conductivity, pH, nitrate, sulfate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon. The spatial AICC methodology allowed us to fit the autocorrelation and covariate parameters simultaneously and to select the model with the most support in the data. We used the universal kriging algorithm to generate geostatistical model predictions. We found that spatial correlation exists in stream chemistry data at a relatively coarse scale and that geostatistical models consistently improved the accuracy of model predictions. More than one distance measure performed well for most chemical response variables, but straight-line distance appears to be the most suitable distance measure for regional geostatistical modeling. It may be necessary to develop new survey designs that more fully capture spatial correlation at a variety of scales to improve the use of weighted asymmetric hydrologic distance measures in regional geostatistical models.},

abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) depositions are expected to increase in the tropics as a consequence of increasing human activities in the next decades. In the literature, it is frequently assumed that tropical montane forests are N-limited, while tropical lowland forests are P-limited. In a low-level N and P addition experiment, we determined the short-term response of N and P cycles in a north Andean montane forest on Palaeozoic shists and metasandstones at an elevation of 2100m a.s.l. to increased N and P inputs. We evaluated experimental N, P and N+P additions (50kgha-1yr-1 of N, 10kgha-1yr-1 of P and 50kg+10kgha-1yr-1 of N and P, respectively) and an untreated control in a fourfold replicated randomized block design. We collected litter leachate, mineral soil solution (0.15 and 0.30m depths), throughfall and litterfall before the treatment began (August 2007) until 16 months after the first nutrient application (April 2009). Less than 10 and 1{\%} of the applied N and P, respectively, leached below the organic layer which contained almost all roots and no significant leaching losses of N and P occurred to below 0.15m mineral soil depth. Deposited N and P from the atmosphere in dry and wet form were retained in the canopy of the control treatment using a canopy budget model. Nitrogen and P retention by the canopy were reduced and N and P fluxes in throughfall and litterfall increased in their respective treatments. The increase in N and P fluxes in throughfall after fertilization was equivalent to 2.5{\%} of the applied N and 2{\%} of the applied P. The fluxes of N and P in litterfall were up to 15{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively, higher in the N and N+P than in the control treatments. We conclude that the expected elevated N and P deposition in the tropics will be retained in the ecosystem, at least in the short term and hence, N and P concentrations in stream water will not increase. Our results suggest that in the studied tropical montane forest ecosystem on Palaeozoic bedrock, N and P are co-limiting the growth of organisms in the canopy and organic layer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A variety of ecological information from both temperate and tropical eels of the genus Anguilla provided the first chance to evaluate the relationship between their life history patterns and phylogenetic relationships. Recent studies indicated that much shorter migrations of a few hundred kilometers are made by tropical eels to spawn in areas near their freshwater habitats, clearly contrasting with the long distance migrations of their counterparts in temperate regions, such as European A. anguilla, American A. rostrata and Japanese eels A. japonica. Molecular phylogeny indicated that the species inhabiting tropics such as A. borneensis in Borneo or A. mossambica in the Indian Ocean are likely to be the most ancestral. These findings suggested a scenario of these tropical species with short migration giving rise to temperate species with long migrations.  This paper outlines the recent findings on the ecology of anguillid species such as their spawning sites, larval migrations, recruitment, growth phase and down stream migrations as well as their molecular phylogenetic relationships and population genetics. Based on these findings, the present state of our understanding about the evolution of migration in the genus Anguilla and future perspectives are discussed.},

abstract = {The relationships among light-saturated photosynthesis and concentrations of nitrogen and ribulose-1,5- bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39) in Australian native plants are poorly known, primarily due to the difficulty of extracting and analysing Rubisco from such species. Rubisco may be rapidly quantified in crude extracts of plant tissue by capillary electrophoresis (CE); however, the presence of phenolic compounds in many Australian native plants limits the use of these methods. The addition of insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) during leaf extractions effectively removed phenols permitting quantitation of Rubisco. Relationships among maximum rates of photosynthesis and concentrations of nitrogen and Rubisco were then investigated in ten species native to Australia. Total nitrogen and the major pools of N in foliage varied greatly between species. Equally, within species N-partitioning was highly plastic, as affected by different concentrations and forms of N applied in sand culture (0.5 or 8 mM, nitrate or ammonium). In Hakea prostrata, for example, the proportion of total N present as soluble proteins varied between 43 and 71{\%}, while the proportion of total N present as Rubisco N ranged between 9.4 and 30.0{\%}, and the contribution of Rubisco to soluble proteins varied between 21 and 42{\%}. The measured concentration of Rubisco varied between 40{\%} and 600{\%} of that estimated from enzyme kinetics and measured rates of photosynthesis. Generally there was a large �excess� of Rubisco, and in only two cases was the measured concentration of Rubisco significantly less than predicted. Total N, soluble protein and Rubisco concentrations were poorly related to maximum rates of photosynthesis, while the relationship between photosynthesis and Rubisco was worse than that with N, primarily due to the plants� variable over-investment in Rubisco.  },

abstract = {In this review, we synthesize field and culture studies of the 15N/14N (expressed as $\delta$15N) of autotrophic plants, mycoheterotrophic plants, parasitic plants, soil, and mycorrhizal fungi to assess the major controls of isotopic patterns. One major control for plants and fungi is the partitioning of nitrogen (N) into either 15N-depleted chitin, ammonia, or transfer compounds or 15N-enriched proteinaceous N. For example, parasitic plants and autotrophic hosts are similar in $\delta$15N (with no partitioning between chitin and protein), mycoheterotrophic plants are higher in $\delta$15 N than their fungal hosts, presumably with preferential assimilation of fungal protein, and autotrophic, mycorrhizal plants are lower in 15N than their fungal symbionts, with saprotrophic fungi intermediate, because mycorrhizal fungi transfer 15N-depleted ammonia or amino acids to plants. Similarly, nodules of N2-fixing bacteria transferring ammonia are often higher in $\delta$15N than their plant hosts. N losses via denitrification greatly influence bulk soil $\delta$15N, whereas $\delta$15N patterns within soil profiles are influenced both by vertical patterns of N losses and by N transfers within the soil-plant system. Climate correlates poorly with soil $\delta$15N; climate may primarily influence $\delta$15N patterns in soils and plants by determining the primary loss mechanisms and which types of mycorrhizal fungi and associated vegetation dominate across climatic gradients.},

abstract = {Knowledge of carbon exchange between the atmosphere, land and the oceans is important, given that the terrestrial and marine environments are currently absorbing about half of the carbon dioxide that is emitted by fossil-fuel combustion. This carbon uptake is therefore limiting the extent of atmospheric and climatic change, but its long-term nature remains uncertain. Here we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of global and regional patterns of carbon exchange by terrestrial ecosystems. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen data confirm that the terrestrial biosphere was largely neutral with respect to net carbon exchange during the 1980s, but became a net carbon sink in the 1990s. This recent sink can be largely attributed to northern extratropical areas, and is roughly split between North America and Eurasia. Tropical land areas, however, were approximately in balance with respect to carbon exchange, implying a carbon sink that offset emissions due to tropical deforestation. The evolution of the terrestrial carbon sink is largely the result of changes in land use over time, such as regrowth on abandoned agricultural land and fire prevention, in addition to responses to environmental changes, such as longer growing seasons, and fertilization by carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Nevertheless, there remain considerable uncertainties as to the magnitude of the sink in different regions and the contribution of different processes.},

Articles with a strong concentration on modelling were selected from the available literature, and all articles around the existing "ecological modelling groups" dealing with the area of the North Sea were sorted in chronological order of their appearance in the literature. We found eleven of such groups and described their different modelling efforts. Selecting the seven three-dimensional models (NORWECOM, GHER, ECOHAM, ERSEM, ELISE, COHERENS and POL3dERSEM), we characterized the complexity of the models, by comparing the resolution in time and space, and the resolution of the trophic structure by discussing the number and kind of state variables and of the processes relating these state variables to each other. The review of biogeochemical/ecological modelling for the greater North Sea shows that important findings by model simulations have either confirmed existing knowledge derived from field work or have given new insight into the mechanisms of the functioning of the North Sea system: the temporal and spatial development and magnitude of primary production, its spreading from the coasts to the north-west over the open North Sea, its mechanisms of limitation, the functioning of the pelagic small food web and of the benthic web, the mechanisms of nutrient regeneration, the effects of riverine and atmospheric nutrient inputs causing eutrophication of coastal waters, the extent of eutrophication in the North Sea, and the budgets for nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon. The three-dimensional ecological models of the greater North Sea have provided consistent distributions and dynamics of the lower trophic levels on their regional, annual and decadal scales which cannot be derived to this degree of coverage by observations.

Studies of the impact of increased reactive N on forest ecosystems—impacts on hydrologic and gaseous loss pathways, retention capacity, and even net primary productivity—have been particularly limited by a lack of long-term baseline biogeochemical data. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis (ratio of 15N to 14N, termed $\delta$15N) of wood chronologies offers the potential to address changes in ecosystem N cycling on millennial timescales and across broad geographic regions. Currently, nearly 50 studies have been published utilizing wood $\delta$15N records; however, there are significant differences in study design and data interpretation. Here, we identify four categories of wood $\delta$15N studies, summarize the common themes and primary findings of each category, identify gaps in the spatial and temporal scope of current wood $\delta$15N chronologies, and synthesize methodological frameworks for future research by presenting eight suggestions for common methodological approaches and enhanced integration across studies. Wood $\delta$15N records have the potential to provide valuable information for interpreting modern biogeochemical cycling. This review serves to advance the utility of this technique for long-term biogeochemical reconstructions.},

We then explain different types of uncertainty (i.e. classical and Berkson error) and use two statistical methods that incorporate uncertainty in climate variables into SDMs by means of (i) hierarchical modelling and (ii) simulation–extrapolation. * We used simulation to study the consequences of failure to account for measurement error. When uncertainty in explanatory variables was not accounted for, we found that coefficient estimates were biased and the SDM had a loss of statistical power. Further, this bias led to biased predictions when projecting change in distribution under climate change scenarios. The proposed errors-in-variables methods were less sensitive to these issues. * We also fit the proposed models to real data (presence/absence data on the Carolina wren, Thryothorus ludovicianus), as a function of temperature variables. * The proposed framework allows for many possible extensions and improvements to SDMs. If information on the uncertainty of spatial climate variables is available to researchers, we recommend the following: (i) first identify the type of uncertainty; (ii) consider whether any spatial autocorrelation or independence assumptions are required; and (iii) attempt to incorporate the uncertainty into the SDM through established statistical methods and their extensions.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that there has been a reduction in dry season moisture input from direct interception of cloud water and wind-blown mist at the lee edge of the Monteverde cloud forest, Costa Rica, since the mid 1970s. This reduction of moisture could be responsible for the population crashes of anurans observed in the region. It has been hypothesized that this behavior is a result of increases in cloud base height, linked to increased sea surface temperatures. In this study we present a complementary hypothesis, that deforestation upwind of the Monteverde cloud forest preserve is responsible for the observed changes in cloud base height. An automated cumulus cloud classification scheme extracts monthly spatial maps of the frequency of occurrence of cumulus cloudiness over Costa Rica from GOES 8 visible channel satellite imagery. We find that cumulus cloud formation in the morning hours over deforested regions is suppressed compared to forested areas. The degree of suppression appears to be related to the extent of deforestation. This difference in cloud formation between forested and deforested areas is a clear signal of land use change influencing the regional climate. Regional Atmospheric Modeling System numerical modeling simulations are used to explore the differences in cloud field characteristics over the lowland pasture and forest landscapes. Statistically significant differences in cloud base height and cloud thickness occur between the forest and pasture simulations. Clouds have higher base heights and are thinner over pasture landscapes than over forested ones. On the other hand, these simulations show no statistically significant differences in cloud top heights, cloud cover, mean cloud water mixing ratio, or cloud liquid water path between pasture and forest simulations. However, in the simulations there are enhanced sensible heat fluxes and reduced latent heat fluxes over pasture compared to forest. It is the drier and warmer air over pasture surfaces that results in the formation of elevated thinner clouds. This study suggests that deforestation results in warmer, drier air upwind of the Monteverde cloud forests and that this could influence the base height of orographic cloudbanks crucial to the region during the dry season.},

abstract = {In this paper, we apply recently developed positivity preserving and conservative Modified Patankar-type solvers for ordinary differential equations to a simple stiff biogeochemical model for the water column. The performance of this scheme is compared to schemes which are not unconditionally positivity preserving (the first-order Euler and the second- and fourth-order Runge–Kutta schemes) and to schemes which are not conservative (the first- and second-order Patankar schemes). The biogeochemical model chosen as a test ground is a standard nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton–detritus (NPZD) model, which has been made stiff by substantially decreasing the half saturation concentration for nutrients. For evaluating the stiffness of the biogeochemical model, so-called numerical time scales are defined which are obtained empirically by applying high-resolution numerical schemes. For all ODE solvers under investigation, the temporal error is analysed for a simple exponential decay law. The performance of all schemes is compared to a high-resolution high-order reference solution. As a result, the second-order modified Patankar–Runge–Kutta scheme gives a good agreement with the reference solution even for time steps 10 times longer than the shortest numerical time scale of the problem. Other schemes do either compute negative values for non-negative state variables (fully explicit schemes), violate conservation (the Patankar schemes) or show low accuracy (all first-order schemes).},

The slope of the Amax-N relationship, change in A per change in N ($\mu$mol CO₂ {\$}\backslashtext{\{}gN{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}\backslashtext{\{}s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} ), was consistently greater, by as much as 300{\%}, when both measures were expressed on mass rather than area bases. The x-intercept of this relationship (N-compensation point) was generally positive on a mass but not an area basis. In this paper we address the causes and implications of such differences. Significant linear relationships (p {\textless} 0.05) between mass-based leaf N (Nmass) and SLA were observed in 12 species and all 23 regressions had positive slopes. In 13 species, mass-based Amax ( {\$}\backslashtext{\{}A{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}mass{\}}{\}}{\$} ) was positively related (p {\textless} 0.05) with SLA. These patterns reflect the concurrent decline in Nmass and SLA with increasing leaf age. Significant (p {\textless} 0.05) relationships between area-based leaf N ( {\$}\backslashtext{\{}N{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}area{\}}{\}}{\$} ) and SLA were observed in 18 species. In this case, all relationships had negative slopes. Taken collectively, and consistent in all species, as SLA decreased (leaves become "thicker") across increasing leaf age and light gradients, Nmass also decreased, but proportionally more slowly, such that {\$}\backslashtext{\{}N{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}area{\}}{\}}{\$} increased. Due to the linear dependence of {\$}\backslashtext{\{}A{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}mass{\}}{\}}{\$} on Nmass and a negative 4-intercept, "thicker" leaves (low SLA) therefore tend, on average, to have lower Nmass and {\$}\backslashtext{\{}A{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}mass{\}}{\}}{\$} but higher {\$}\backslashtext{\{}N{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}area{\}}{\}}{\$} than "thinner" leaves. This tendency towards decreasing {\$}\backslashtext{\{}A{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}mass{\}}{\}}{\$} with increasing {\$}\backslashtext{\{}N{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}area{\}}{\}}{\$} decreases the rate at which {\$}\backslashtext{\{}A{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}area{\}}{\}}{\$} increases with {\$}\backslashtext{\{}N{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}area{\}}{\}}{\$} , resulting in a lower slope of the Amax-N relationship on an area than mass basis in 16 of 17 species where both were significant. For the sole species exception (higher area than mass-based slope) variation in {\$}\backslashtext{\{}N{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}area{\}}{\}}{\$} was related to variation in Nmass and not in SLA, and thus, these data are also consistent with this explanation. The relations between N, SLA and Amax explain how the rate of change in Amax per change in N can vary three-fold depending on whether a mass or area mode of expression is used.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {An accurate characterization of tree carbon (TC), forest floor carbon (FFC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in tropical forest plantations is important to estimate their contribution to global carbon stocks. This information, however, is poor and fragmented. Carbon contents were assessed in patula pine (Pinus patula) and teak (Tectona grandis) stands in tropical forest plantations of different development stages in combination with inventory assessments and soil survey information. Growth models were used to associate TOC to tree normal diameter (D) with average basal area and total tree height (HT), with D and HT parameters that can be used in 6-26 years old patula pine and teak in commercial tropical forests as indicators of carbon stocks. The information was obtained from individual trees in different development stages in 54 patula pine plots and 42 teak plots. The obtained TC was 99.6Mgha-1 in patula pine and 85.7Mgha-1 in teak forests. FFC was 2.3 and 1.2Mgha-1, SOC in the surface layer (0-25cm) was 92.6 and 35.8Mgha-1, 76.1 and 19Mgha-1 in deep layers (25-50cm) in patula pine and teak, respectively. Carbon storage in trees was similar between patula pine and teak plantations, but patula pine had higher levels of forest floor carbon and soil organic carbon. Carbon storage in trees represents 37 and 60{\%} of the total carbon content in patula pine and teak plantations, respectively. Even so, the remaining percentage corresponds to SOC, whereas FFC content is less than 1{\%}. In summary, differences in carbon stocks between patula pine and teak trees were not significant, but the distribution of carbon differed between the plantation types. The low FFC does not explain the SOC stocks; however, current variability of SOC stocks could be related to variation in land use history. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forest structure and dynamics have been noted to vary across the Amazon Basin in an east-west gradient in a pattern which coincides with variations in soil fertility and geology. This has resulted in the hypothesis that soil fertility may play an important role in explaining Basin-wide variations in forest biomass, growth and stem turnover rates. To test this hypothesis and assess the importance of edaphic properties in affect forest structure and dynamics, soil and plant samples were collected in a total of 59 different forest plots across the Amazon Basin. Samples were analysed for exchangeable cations, C, N, pH with various P fractions also determined. Physical properties were also examined and an index of soil physical quality developed. Overall, forest structure and dynamics were found to be strongly and quantitatively related to edaphic conditions. Tree turnover rates emerged to be mostly influenced by soil physical properties whereas forest growth rates were mainly related to a measure of available soil phosphorus, although also dependent on rainfall amount and distribu tion. On the other hand, large scale variations in forest biomass could not be explained by any of the edaphic properties measured, nor by variation in climate. A new hypothesis of self-maintaining forest dynamic feedback mechanisms initiated by edaphic conditions is proposed. It is further suggested that this is a major factor determining forest disturbance levels, species composition and forest productivity on a Basin wide scale.},

The original view, which is still widely accepted, holds that the relationship is hump-shaped, with richness first rising and then declining with increasing productivity. Although recent meta-analyses questioned the generality of hump-shaped patterns, these syntheses have been criticized for failing to account for methodological differences among studies. We addressed such concerns by conducting standardized sampling in 48 herbaceous-dominated plant communities on five continents. We found no clear relationship between productivity and fine-scale (meters(-2)) richness within sites, within regions, or across the globe. Ecologists should focus on fresh, mechanistic approaches to understanding the multivariate links between productivity and richness.},

abstract = {Soils in equilibrium with a natural forest ecosystem have high carbon (C) density. The ratio of soil:vegetation C density increases with latitude. Land use change, particularly conversion to agricultural ecosystems, depletes the soil C stock. Thus, degraded agricultural soils have lower soil organic carbon (SOC) stock than their potential capacity. Consequently, afforestation of agricultural soils and management of forest plantations can enhance SOC stock through C sequestration. The rate of SOC sequestration, and the magnitude and quality of soil C stock depend on the complex interaction between climate, soils, tree species and management, and chemical composition of the litter as determined by the dominant tree species. Increasing production of forest biomass per se may not necessarily increase the SOC stocks. Fire, natural or managed, is an important perturbation that can affect soil C stock for a long period after the event. The soil C stock can be greatly enhanced by a careful site preparation, adequate soil drainage, growing species with a high NPP, applying N and micronutrients (Fe) as fertilizers or biosolids, and conserving soil and water resources. Climate change may also stimulate forest growth by enhancing availability of mineral N and through the CO2 fertilization effect, which may partly compensate release of soil C in response to warming. There are significant advances in measurement of soil C stock and fluxes, and scaling of C stock from pedon/plot scale to regional and national scales. Soil C sequestration in boreal and temperate forests may be an important strategy to ameliorate changes in atmospheric chemistry. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the use of species distribution models (SDMs) to characterize patterns of species' occurrence and abundance. Efforts to parameterize SDMs often create a tension between the quality and quantity of data available to fit models. Estimation methods that integrate both standardized and non-standardized data types offer a potential solution to the tradeoff between data quality and quantity. Recently several authors have developed approaches for jointly modeling two sources of data (one of high quality and one of lesser quality). We extend their work by allowing for explicit spatial autocorrelation in occurrence and detection error using a Multivariate Conditional Autoregressive (MVCAR) model and develop three models that share information in a less direct manner resulting in more robust performance when the auxiliary data is of lesser quality. We describe these three new approaches (“Shared,” “Correlation,” “Covariates”) for combining data sources and show their use in a case study of the Brown-headed Nuthatch in the Southeastern U.S. and through simulations. All three of the approaches which used the second data source improved out-of-sample predictions relative to a single data source (“Single”). When information in the second data source is of high quality, the Shared model performs the best, but the Correlation and Covariates model also perform well. When the information quality in the second data source is of lesser quality, the Correlation and Covariates model performed better suggesting they are robust alternatives when little is known about auxiliary data collected opportunistically or through citizen scientists. Methods that allow for both data types to be used will maximize the useful information available for estimating species distributions.},

abstract = {Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated the widespread existence of spatio-temporal variations in the abundance and distribution of species of freshwater fishes, previously assumed not to move between habitats. These movements are often on a seasonal or ontogenetic basis, for spawning, feeding and refuge, and in many cases are fundamental for the successful completion of lifecycles. This important book provides a single source for a range of previously widely dispersed information on these movements of fish in fresh waters, covering potamodromous fishes as well as the more familiar diadromous species, worldwide. Contents include full descriptions of types of migration and spatial behaviour, the stimulus and capacity for fish to migrate, the effects of climate on patterns of migratory behaviour, a taxonomic analysis (mostly by family) of freshwater fish migration, methods for studying migration, and details of the impacts of man's activities on freshwater fish migration. Migration of Freshwater Fishes provides an excellent and comprehensive reference to which the river manager, biologist or student can now refer to obtain information, advice and current opinion on the migratory behaviour of most taxonomic groups of fishes occurring in fresh water. University libraries and aquatic research stations should also have copies of this essential reference book on their shelves. Well-known international authors. Of great commercial importance to fisheries and professional angling bodies. Draws together much new information in one place. Detailed review of world wide migratory behaviour for most groups of freshwater fishes. Pure and applied relevance, for academics, fisheries scientists, river managers and conservationists.

abstract = {1. Throughout the world, decreased connectivity of fluvial habitats caused by artificial river channel alterations such as culverts, weirs and dykes is seen as an important threat to the long-term survival of many aquatic species. In addition to assessing habitat quality and abundance, wildlife managers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of taking into account habitat connectivity when setting priorities for restoration. In this paper, a new approach of spatial analysis adapted to rivers and streams is proposed for modelling 2D functional habitat connectivity, integrating distance, costs and risk of travelling between habitat patches (e.g. daily use, spawning, refuge) for particular fish species, size classes and life stages. 2. This approach was applied to a case study in which brown trout (Salmo trutta) habitat accessibility was examined and compared under various scenarios of stream restoration in a highly fragmented stream in Ile-de-France. Probabilities of reaching spawning habitats were estimated from a trout-populated area located downstream of the barriers and from potential daily-use habitat patches across the stream segment. 3. The approach successfully helped prioritize restoration actions by identifying options that yield the greatest increase in accessible spawning habitat areas and connectivity between spawning habitat and daily-use habitat patches. This case study illustrates the practical use of the approach and the software in the context of river habitat management.},

abstract = {Microbial nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) describes the partitioning of organic N taken up between growth and the release of inorganic N to the environment (that is, N mineralization), and is thus central to our understanding of N cycling. Here we report empirical evidence that microbial decomposer communities in soil and plant litter regulate their NUE. We find that microbes retain most immobilized organic N (high NUE), when they are N limited, resulting in low N mineralization. However, when the metabolic control of microbial decomposers switches from N to C limitation, they release an increasing fraction of organic N as ammonium (low NUE). We conclude that the regulation of NUE is an essential strategy of microbial communities to cope with resource imbalances, independent of the regulation of microbial carbon use efficiency, with significant effects on terrestrial N cycling.},

@article{Arndt2007,
abstract = {[1] A two-dimensional, nested grid, hydrodynamic, and reactive-transport model of the macrotidal Scheldt estuary (B/NL) and its tributaries has been developed to identify the driving forces controlling the temporal and spatial dynamics of primary production during a summer diatom bloom. The hydrodynamic model indicates that energy dissipation reaches its maximum 90 km upstream from the mouth, closely followed by a minimum farther upstream. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics is simulated to provide the transient light conditions in the water column. Results show that the spatial distribution of SPM mirrors closely the profile of energy dissipation. The temporal SPM dynamics is highly sensitive to fluctuations in river discharge, whose influence decreases downstream. Peaks in SPM are triggered by high discharges and can be recorded as far as 50 km seaward of the upstream model boundary. Results from the phytoplankton model demonstrate the fast response of diatom growth to changes in the physical environment, especially those due to daily variations in river discharge which continuously modify the SPM concentrations and residence times. Episodes of persistent low flow conditions lead to a progressive depletion of dissolved silica. Simulated diatom growth becomes increasingly controlled by silica availability, until primary production collapses. The spatiotemporal evolution of primary production is explored over the entire domain of forcing conditions. The distribution of the daily maximum of net primary production and its location reveal that four different system states can be identified in the forcing planes. The transition from one state to the other characterizes the diatom growth response in the estuary.},

abstract = {Improved management of carbon storage by terrestrial biomes has significant value for mitigating climate change. The carbon value of such management has the potential to provide additional income to rural communities and provide biodiversity and climate adaptation co-benefits. Here, we quantify the carbon stores in a 49,300-ha landscape centered on the cloud forest-grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru. Aboveground carbon densities were measured across the landscape by field sampling of 70 sites above and below the treeline. The forest near the treeline contained 63.4 +/- A 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) aboveground, with an additional 13.9 +/- A 2.8 Mg C ha(-1) estimated to be stored in the coarse roots, using a root to shoot ratio of 0.26. Puna grasslands near the treeline were found to store 7.5 +/- A 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) in aboveground biomass. Comparing our result to soil data gathered by Zimmermann and others (Ecosystems 13:62-74, 2010), we found the ratio of belowground:aboveground carbon decreased from 15.8 on the puna to 8.6 in the transition zone and 2.1 in the forest. No significant relationships were found between carbon densities and slope, altitude or fire disturbance history, though grazing (for puna) was found to reduce aboveground carbon densities significantly. We scaled our study sites to the study region with remote sensing observations from Landsat. The carbon sequestration potential of improved grazing management and assisted upslope treeline migration was also estimated. Afforestation of puna at the treeline could generate revenues of US {\$}1,374 per ha over the project lifetime via commercialization of the carbon credits from gains in aboveground carbon stocks. Uncertainties in the fate of the large soil carbon stocks under an afforestation scenario exist.},

abstract = {Tree growth response across environmental gradients is fundamental to understanding species distributional ecology and forest ecosystem ecology and to predict future ecosystem services. Cross-sectional patterns of ecosystem properties with respect to climatic gradients are often used to predict ecosystem responses to global change. Across sites in the tropics, primary productivity increases with temperature, suggesting that forest ecosystems will become more productive as temperature rises. However, this trend is confounded with a shift in species composition and so may not reflect the response of in situ forests to warming. In this study, we simultaneously studied tree diameter growth across the altitudinal ranges of species within a single genus across a geographically compact temperature gradient, to separate the direct effect of temperature on tree growth from that of species compositional turnover. Using a Bayesian state space modeling framework we combined data from repeated diameter censuses and dendrometer measurements from across a 1700-m altitudinal gradient collected over six years on over 2400 trees in Weinmannia, a dominant and widespread genus of cloud forest trees in the Andes. Within species, growth showed no consistent trend with altitude, but higher-elevation species had lower growth rates than lower-elevation species, suggesting that species turnover is largely responsible for the positive correlation between productivity and temperature in tropical forests. Our results may indicate a significant difference in how low- and high-latitude forests will respond to climate change, since temperate and boreal tree species are consistently observed to have a positive relationship between growth and temperature. If our results hold for other tropical species, a positive response in ecosystem productivity to increasing temperatures in the Andes will depend on the altitudinal migration of tree species. The rapid pace of climate change, and slow observed rates of migration, suggest a slow, or even initially negative response of ecosystem productivity to warming. Finally, this study shows how the observed scale of biological organization can affect conclusions drawn from studies of ecological phenomena across environmental gradients, and calls into question the common practice in tropical ecology of lumping species at higher taxonomic levels.},

abstract = {We investigated long-term trends (1965-2002) in dissolved inorganic nutrients in the tidal part of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, The Netherlands). Annually averaged concentrations of dissolved silicate (DSi), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and phosphate (DIP) increased significantly until the mid-1970s, after which they declined linearly at rates of 0.6, 2.9, and 0.3 mu mol L-1 yr(-1), respectively. This co-occurred with a deterioration followed by a restoration of water column oxic conditions. Because of the differences in the reduction rate of DSi (1.2{\%} yr(-1)), DIN (1.7{\%} yr(-1)), and DIP (5.4{\%} yr(-1)) the N: P and Si: P ratios more than doubled from 1980 to 2002. The Si: N ratio varied from 0.2 to 0.4 and was positively correlated with river discharge. The part downstream from the confluence of the main rivers was a net sink for DSi during the entire period but evolved from a net sink to a net source for DIP, while the reverse was true for DIN. This differential behavior of the estuary with respect to DIN and DIP strongly buffered the altered loadings to the upper estuary. The input of oxygen-consuming substances at the head of the estuary triggered a sequence of oxidation reactions. In the early 1970s, high loadings of ammonium and organic matter caused oxygen depletion and intense water-column denitrification in the upstream part and intense nitrification downstream, with a nitrate maximum succeeding a nitrite peak. With oxic conditions improving and the input of ammonium decreasing, water-column denitrification declined, the nitrification front migrated upstream, and the estuary evolved from a net producer of nitrite to a net consumer. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, nitrate behaves almost conservatively over the entire estuary.},

We present the results of a survey of 159 productivity-plant species richness (P-PSR) relationships from 131 published studies. We critically assessed each study with respect to experimental design and for the appropriateness of the surrogates used for productivity. We were able to accept only 60 of the reported relationships as robust tests of the P-PSR relationship and a further 18 as robust tests of the biomass species richness relationship. Previous analyses have found that unimodal P-PSR relationships predominate. In contrast, we found that, in studies that used data of continental to global extent, all P-PSR relationships were positive regardless of grain, that almost all were also positive in data sets of regional extent, and that unimodal relationships were not dominant even in studies of fine grain or small spatial extent. Our results differ substantially from previous meta-analyses because previous studies have included a large number of studies that do not meet basic experimental design criteria for objectively testing P-PSR relationships. These results have important implications for theory that attempts to explain species richness patterns. We critically review four dominant theories in light of our results and develop new falsifiable predictions of relationship from these theories at both small and large spatial scales.},

abstract = {Background Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) are characterized by a unique set of biological and hydroclimatic features, including frequent and/or persistent fog, cool temperatures, and high biodiversity and endemism. These forests are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate change given their small geographic range, high endemism and dependence on a rare microclimatic envelope. The frequency of atmospheric water deficits for some TMCFs is likely to increase in the future, but the consequences for the integrity and distribution of these ecosystems are uncertain. In order to investigate plant and ecosystem responses to climate change, we need to know how TMCF species function in response to current climate, which factors shape function and ecology most and how these will change into the future. Scope This review focuses on recent advances in ecophysiological research of TMCF plants to establish a link between TMCF hydrometeorological conditions and vegetation distribution, functioning and survival. The hydraulic characteristics of TMCF trees are discussed, together with the prevalence and ecological consequences of foliar uptake of fog water (FWU) in TMCFs, a key process that allows efficient acquisition of water during cloud immersion periods, minimizing water deficits and favouring survival of species prone to drought-induced hydraulic failure. Conclusions Fog occurrence is the single most important microclimatic feature affecting the distribution and function of TMCF plants. Plants in TMCFs are very vulnerable to drought (possessing a small hydraulic safety margin), and the presence of fog and FWU minimizes the occurrence of tree water deficits and thus favours the survival of TMCF trees where such deficits may occur. Characterizing the interplay between microclimatic dynamics and plant water relations is key to foster more realistic projections about climate change effects on TMCF functioning and distribution.},

For this, a series of successive airborne Thematic Mapper thermal images was acquired of Kirkcudbright Bay, an estuary in the United Kingdom, on two dates. Spatial dynamics were determined by two techniques: (1) qualitatively, which involved interpreting features 'by eye'; and (2) by the velocimetric technique of maximum cross correlation (MCC). Qualitatively, complex spatial dynamics were identified over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, associated with the creation and dissipation of eddies, and the convergence and divergence of fronts, all of which were superimposed on the synoptic tidal flow. MCC was effective for producing synoptic velocity fields, but the minimum cell size was constrained by image noise, limiting the ability to analyze small-scale spatial dynamics. The effectiveness of MCC was related to the ratio of spatially correlated variance to spatially independent variance, as estimated from the variogram. Suggestions for optimizing the application of airborne remote sensing to estuarine spatial dynamics are presented. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The transmitter expulsions were validated using an egg map, which was based on visual observations of perch egg-strands, and 11 of the 12 expulsed transmitters (92{\%}) were located in areas with eggs. Many fish spawned in the brackish water with salinities up to 9.6 PSU.

These two hypotheses were assessed in one forest type, intertidal mangroves, using fertilized plots at sites between latitudes 36 masculine S and 27 masculine N. The N and P concentrations in mangrove leaf tissue increased with latitude, but there were no trends in N : P ratios. Growth rates of trees, adjusted for average minimum temperature showed a significant increase with latitude supporting the Growth Rate Hypothesis. However, support for the Geochemical Hypothesis was also strong; both photosynthetic P use efficiency and nutrient resorption efficiency decreased with increasing latitude, indicating that P was less limiting to metabolism at the higher latitudes. Our study supports the hypothesis that historically low P availability in the tropics has been an important selective pressure shaping the evolution of plant traits.},

The future of this sink relies critically on forest interactions with nutrient cycles(3-5). Humid montane tropical forests are often thought to be rich in phosphorus, but to contain low levels of bioavailable nitrogen(6). Here, we examine the concentration of dissolved nitrogen compounds and the isotopic composition of nitrate in streams in six well-characterized and phosphorus-rich montane forests(7) in Costa Rica, and in 55 montane forests across Central America and the Caribbean, using data collected between 1990 and 2008. We found high levels of nitrate in these streams, indicative of large losses of bioavailable nitrogen from these forests. We detected no trend in the concentration and isotopic signature of nitrate over the measurement period, implying that high levels of export are neither recent nor episodic. An analysis of the oxygen isotopic signature of stream nitrate showed that exports are sourced from the plant-soil system, rather than from atmospheric deposition that bypasses forest biota. Our findings indicate that nitrogen-rich conditions can develop irrespective of phosphorus availability at the ecosystem scale. We suggest that nitrogen availability may not limit plant growth, or its response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, in many montane tropical forests.},

abstract = {This study investigates the potential of spatio-temporal kriging approaches for daily mean PM10 concentrations. The methods used include separate daily variogram estimates, temporally evolving variograms, the metric model, the separable covariance model and the product-sum model, and are combined with multiple linear regression. These methods are applied to daily mean rural background PM10 concentrations across Europe for the year 2005, and incorporate daily EMEP model data and elevation data as predictors.$\backslash$nThe air quality indicators used in this study are the daily and yearly mean PM10 concentrations and the number of days exceeding the limit value 50 µg/m³ (NOE). The quality assessment of the different techniques relies on a cross-validation. Statistical measures are used to quantify the improvement for different indicators.$\backslash$nIt is shown that daily interpolations can improve the statistical performance of the interpolation of annual mean PM10 concentrations. Furthermore, some advantages of daily estimates are described. Besides the improvement in annual mean PM10 concentration maps, studying the phenomenon in a wider spatio-temporal context becomes possible with daily estimates. Especially the estimation the number of days PM10 concentrations exceed certain limits can be done in a more natural way. Likewise, the detection of outliers and data inhomogeneity benefits from a daily spatio-temporal model.$\backslash$nInterpolation with the simple spatio-temporal variogram models used here exploits the temporal correlations present and out performs the purely spatial interpolation methods. Based on temporal variability of the spatial short-distance variation component, a discussion is given on the suitability of this statistic to infer measurement errors, and alternative approaches are proposed.},

abstract = {Land suitability mapping requires information about climate, topography, and soils in relation to crop performance. Climatic data are available from recording stations which present point samples and so interpolation is needed to generate estimates for non-sampled points. The annual temperature cycle must be interpolated differently for different land suitability projects. A common theme, however, is spatial interpolation and here we investigate the application of kriging with external drift to mapping January mean temperatures in Scotland. The spatial structure of the mean temperature is analysed using variograms computed in different directions. From these we see that January temperature is second-order stationary in the north-south direction. Hence the variogram exists in that direction and is taken to represent the underlying variogram. This variogram is modelled and used in universal kriging to produce point-kriged estimates on a 5-km square grid. These estimates do not adequately show the variation in temperature between stations and so the correlation with elevation was exploited in universal kriging with elevation as external drift. This method gives a kriged estimate for temperature that reproduces the correlation with elevation at the climate stations.},

abstract = {To manage coral reef species, it is impor- tant to identify the factors that determine their dis- tribution inexpensively. We identified the remotely measured environmental factors that are most influen- tial in determining the distributions of coral reef fish species on a regional scale. Logistic regression models for 227 fish species related presence/absence data to 4 remotely determined environmental predictor vari- ables: depth, presence of a land–sea interface, ex- posure, and the distance to the nearest estuary. We compared modeled Akaike information criterion (AIC) values with AIC values of randomly distributed spe- cies with different numbers of occurrences and levels of habitat specificity to evaluate model significance. Efficient species distribution models were identified for 118 predominantly habitat-specific fishes of the 227 species for which we had data. All 4 predictor vari- ables significantly influenced the distributions of at least some fish species. Depth was the most frequently efficient variable for single variable models. For com- binations of 2 predictor variables, depth and exposure, as well as depth and distance from the nearest estuary, were the prevalent predictors of fish distributions. Several fish species responded to the combination of variables distance from an estuary and presence of the terrestrial–marine interface, indicating that these species depend on intact coastal reef habitat, which is in decline near the main sediment-laden rivers. Statistically significant models were predominantly developed for habitat-specific species. These habitat- specific species are of greater conservation concern than widespread species because threats affect them more severely if the threats are selectively affecting their habitat. For this reason, species distribution mod- eling using remotely determined environmental data may be an efficient method to build models for habitat- specific species and inform marine reserve design.},

The results show that the effect of discharge on salinity has a distinct maximum in the polyhaline to mesohaline transition area. Oxygen conditions, nitrogen removal and phytoplankton regulation can be enhanced and improved through management measures within the estuary. To lower carbon and phosphorous loads however measures should be taken within the catchment. To restore most of its ecological functions the estuary needs more space.

abstract = {Geostatistical methods are becoming an essential tool for understanding the spatial distribution of biological and chemical species in estuaries. At the heart of these methods are the spatial prediction/mapping methods known as 'kriging'; these can construct statistically optimal predictions for data at unobserved locations using a relatively small, spatially explicit sample. The prediction at any given location is a weighted average of the sample values, where the weights depend on the distances between the sample sites and the target location. For most geostatistical settings, distances are computed 'as the crow flies', i.e. Euclidean distance. For measurements made in estuarine streams, however, intuition suggests that distances between sites should be measured 'as the fish swims', i.e. the length of the shortest in-water path between two sites. Our study evaluated the relative accuracy of eight kriging methods for predicting contaminant and water quality variables measured in an urbanized estuary in South Carolina. The eight methods were defined by all combinations of three factors, each at two levels: (a) Distance metric (Euclidean vs. in-water); (b) semivariogram type (spherical vs. linear) and (c) model trend component (distance to the inlet mouth; without vs. with). For four of the eight variables studied, the in-water distances provided prediction accuracy improvement on the order of 10-30{\%} of prediction error variance. In two of these cases, the improvement only occurred when in-water distances were used together with a model trend component. Choice of semivariogram did not have much effect on prediction accuracy. Although the overall improvement in prediction accuracy was unpredictable and modest, considering the additional difficulties associated with in-water distances, the results suggest that the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS)-based network analysis with kriging using in-water distances merits further research.},

Advances in electronic tracking technologies have been coupled with rapid development of statistical and analytical techniques. With these developments, conservation of highly migratory species has been aided by providing new information on where uncommon or endangered species go, what behaviors they perform and why, which habitats are critical, and where they range, as well as, in many cases, better estimates of their population size and the interconnectedness of subpopulations. Together these tools are providing critical insights into the ecology of highly pelagic marine vertebrates that are key for their conservation and management.},

abstract = {Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = {\textgreater}0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92{\%} map accuracy) than BRT (68{\%} map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

abstract = {Biodiversity in the Tropical Andes is under continuous threat from anthropogenic activities. Projected changes in climate will likely exacerbate this situation. Using species distribution models, we assess possible future changes in the diversity and climatic niche size of an unprecedented number of species for the region. We modeled a broad range of taxa (11,012 species of birds and vascular plants), including both endemic and widespread species and provide a comprehensive estimation of climate change impacts on the Andes. We find that if no dispersal is assumed, by 2050s, more than 50{\%} of the species studied are projected to undergo reductions of at least 45{\%} in their climatic niche, whilst 10{\%} of species could be extinct. Even assuming unlimited dispersal, most of the Andean endemics (comprising {\~{}}5{\%} of our dataset) would become severely threatened ({\textgreater}50{\%} climatic niche loss). While some areas appear to be climatically stable (e.g. Pichincha and Imbabura in Ecuador; and Nari{\~{n}}o, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Putumayo in Colombia) and hence depict little diversity loss and/or potential species gains, major negative impacts were also observed. Tropical high Andean grasslands (p{\'{a}}ramos and punas) and evergreen montane forests, two key ecosystems for the provision of environmental services in the region, are projected to experience negative changes in species richness and high rates of species turnover. Adapting to these impacts would require a landscape-network based approach to conservation, including protected areas, their buffer zones and corridors. A central aspect of such network is the implementation of an integrated landscape management approach based on sustainable management and restoration practices covering wider areas than currently contemplated. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier GmbH.},

These modelling systems can be used in the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive or to perform any other kind of integrated assessment with regard to water resources management. In such investigations the use of models is inevitable, as integrated water resources management demands the survey of large areas as well as the inclusion of the different functions of the water cycle and water utilisation processes. Water quantity data provides important input for hydro-chemical, hydro-ecological or hydro-economic models. If no significant water resources management activities are realised in the basin under study, these data can be provided by simple rainfall-runoff models. If significant water resources management activities are realised or planned, the effects of these water resources management activities must be taken into consideration. Then, however, the use of water resources management models becomes necessary. Two such modelling systems, WRAP and WBalMo, are compared. Both have been designed for the development and revision of water resources management plans. Due to different approaches regarding the modelling routines the models lead to different results in the calculation of water quantities. By tracking the simulation algorithms, an understanding of the detected differences becomes possible. By adapting the spatial configuration of the modelled system, equivalent results can be obtained.},

abstract = {The long-term net flux of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere has been dominated by two factors: changes in the area of forests and per hectare changes in forest biomass resulting from management and regrowth. While these factors are reasonably well documented in countries of the northern mid-latitudes as a result of systematic forest inventories, they are uncertain in the tropics. Recent estimates of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation have focused on the uncertainty in rates of deforestation. By using the same data for biomass, however, these studies have underestimated the total uncertainty of tropical emissions and may have biased the estimates. In particular, regional and country-specific estimates of forest biomass reported by three successive assessments of tropical forest resources by the FAO indicate systematic changes in biomass that have not been taken into account in recent estimates of tropical carbon emissions. The 'changes' more likely represent improved information than real on-the-ground changes in carbon storage. In either case, however, the data have a significant effect on current estimates of carbon emissions from the tropics and, hence, on understanding the global carbon balance},

Measured rate constants varied by over 1.5 orders of magnitude (0.015-0.67 year(-1)), averaging 0.19 year(-1) with predicted error of 0.026 year. Wood density and bole diameter were significantly and inversely correlated with rate constants. A tree of average biomass was predicted to decompose at 0.17 year(-1).

Mean coarse litter standing-stocks were predicted to be 21 Mg ha(-1) with a mean residence time of 5.9 years, and a maximum mean carbon flux to the atmosphere of 1.8 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Total litter is estimated to be partitioned into 16{\%} fine wood, 30{\%} coarse wood, and 54{\%} non-woody litter (e.g., leaves, fruits, flowers). Decomposition rate constants for coarse litter were compiled from 20 globally distributed studies.

abstract = {Aim To assess the usefulness of combining climate predictors with additional types of environmental predictors in species distribution models for range-restricted species, using common correlative species distribution modelling approaches. Location Florida, USA Methods We used five different algorithms to create distribution models for 14 vertebrate species, using seven different predictor sets: two with bioclimate predictors only, and five ‘combination' models using bioclimate predictors plus ‘additional' predictors from groups representing: human influence, land cover, extreme weather or noise (spatially random data).We use a linear mixed-model approach to analyse the effects of predictor set and algorithm on model accuracy, variable importance scores and spatial predictions. Results Regardless of modelling algorithm, no one predictor set produced significantly more accurate models than all others, though models including human influence predictors were the only ones with significantly higher accuracy than climate-only models. Climate predictors had consistently higher variable importance scores than additional predictors in combination models, though there was variation related to predictor type and algorithm. While spatial predictions varied moderately between predictor sets, discrepancies were significantly greater between modelling algorithms than between predictor sets. Furthermore, there were no differences in the level of agreement between binary ‘presence–absence' maps and independent species range maps related to the predictor set used. Main conclusions Our results indicate that additional predictors have relatively minor effects on the accuracy of climate-based species distribution models and minor to moderate effects on spatial predictions. We suggest that implementing species distribution models with only climate predictors may provide an effective and efficient approach for initial assessments of environmental suitability.},

Great advances were reported in fish surveys using hydroacoustics and multimesh gillnet techniques, with nearly 60{\%} of all presentations dealing with these topics. In contrast, the use of other active sampling gear, especially trawling and purse seining, received relatively little attention and still requires substantial further development. Reviews of standardization of fish sampling in the European Union, Russia and North America were also presented and clearly showed the benefits of standardized procedures. A number of contributions emphasized the need to use a combination of several methods for the same habitat. A true picture of the fish stock includes knowledge of the abundance, biomass, number of species, size and age compositions.

Human pressure on estuaries is very high. On the other hand, it is recognized that estuaries have a unique functional and structural biodiversity. Therefore, these ecosystems are particularly important for integrating sound ecological management with sustainable economics. These opportunities are explored for the Scheldt estuary, a well-documented system with an exceptional tidal freshwater area. In this article a description of the Scheldt estuary is presented, illustrating that human influence is intertwined with natural dynamics.

abstract = {The Andes of Ecuador are known for their outstanding biodiversity but also as the region with the highest deforestation rate in South America. This process is accompanied by accelerating degradation and loss of environmental services. Despite an extraordinary richness in native tree diversity, more than 90{\%} of all forest plantations established in Ecuador consist of exotic species, primarily Eucalyptus spp. and Pinus spp. This is mainly due to the lack of information about the autecological and synecological requirements of the native species. The present study aims at providing basic knowledge on the early height development of native species in comparison to exotics. 12,000 seedlings of exotic and native species were planted in experimental trials at three sites of different successional stages: recently abandoned pastures (Setaria sphacelata), bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum) and shrubs. The results presented in this study refer to the status of the seedlings 3 years after planting. Soil data were revealed from soil core analysis from a total of 1008 soil samples distributed systematically over all plots. Soil chemical data were derived from a subsample of 125 randomly selected soil core sites. Soil properties in the study area emerged to be extremely heterogeneous. More than 60{\%} of all plots presented two or more soil clusters. Soils in general were very poor in plant available N. Soil heterogeneity affected extractable Mn and Mg, dominating vegetation cover in turn affected Mn and P. Differences in soil properties had a strong effect for Eucalyptus saligna and Alnus acuminata. Manual above ground weeding showed species-specific effects: Tabebuia chrysantha and Heliocarpus americanus showed improved height growth, while that of Cedrela montana was reduced. There is evidence that A. acuminata can compete in growth with exotic species. Early successional species and exotics performed best on pasture dominated sites. Height growth of the mid-successional species C. montana was facilitated by bracken fern under certain soil conditions, and shrubs facilitated growth of T. chrysantha. The results indicate that reforestation with native species in Ecuador is possible but requires intensive consideration of interactions with soil properties and accompanying vegetation. Macroscopic soil core analysis can be a suitable instrument for detecting small-scale variation of soil properties. Nevertheless, a characterisation of both small-scale variation as well as variation on higher spatial scales, for instance by aerial photographs, is essential for effective planning of reforestation measures in the Andes. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The accumulation of floating anthropogenic debris in marine and coastal areas has environmental, economic, aesthetic, and human health impacts. Until now, modelling the transport of such debris has largely been restricted to the large-scales of open seas. We used oceanographic modelling to identify potential sites of debris accumulation along a rugged coastline with headlands, islands, rocky coasts and beaches. Our study site was the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area that has an emerging problem with debris accumulation. We found that the classical techniques of modelling the transport of floating debris models are only moderately successful due to a number of unknowns or assumptions, such as the value of the wind drift coefficient, the variability of the oceanic forcing and of the wind, the resuspension of some floating debris by waves, and the poorly known relative contribution of floating debris from urban rivers and commercial and recreational shipping. Nevertheless the model was successful in reproducing a number of observations such as the existence of hot spots of accumulation. The orientation of beaches to the prevailing wind direction affected the accumulation rate of debris. The wind drift coefficient and the exact timing of the release of the debris at sea affected little the movement of debris originating from rivers but it affected measurably that of debris originating from ships. It was thus possible to produce local hotspot maps for floating debris, especially those originating from rivers. Such modelling can be used to inform local management decisions, and it also identifies likely priority research areas to more reliably predict the trajectory and landing points of floating debris.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to use spatially explicit individual-based models for simulating the movement, foraging, growth, and mortality of cod and capelin in the Barents Sea in order to identify general features in their migration patterns and the consumption of capelin by cod. The individual-based models are initiated from survey data run over 1 year and validated against survey information. Directed movement is based on a combination of movement vectors and temperature boundaries, and bioenergetics models are used to calculate growth. Capelin consumption by cod is calculated from local encounters between the species. For capelin, the best movement model can be summarized as: stay southwest of the 2.5??C and 4??C temperature front at 50-m depth for juvenile and mature individuals, respectively, in winter, and migrate northwards during summer, but do not pass the -1.5??C temperature front. The best cod model was to migrate south-southwest during winter and north-northeast during summer, within the temperature range 1??C to 8??C. The annual consumption estimates found here reflected the interannual and seasonal pattern from previous studies based on stomach samples, but were generally lower. Consumption estimates varied depending on the movement models, and the best movement model also produced the consumption estimate closest to that obtained in other studies. Introducing a simple rule stating that cod should move in a randomly selected direction when the local capelin density is zero increased the consumption estimate by 30{\%}. This suggests that more emphasis needs to be put on exploring how behavioural rules in predators and prey affect their interactions. Even though there are some discrepancies between predictions and observations, the results achieved by the model with regard to spatial distribution, growth, and consumption are promising. ?? 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

However, species detection can be extremely difficult in many environments, specific life stages and in populations at very low density. The aim of this study was to improve the knowledge on DNA persistence in water in order to confirm the presence of the focus species in freshwater ecosystems. Aquatic vertebrates (fish: Siberian sturgeon and amphibian: Bullfrog tadpoles) were used as target species. In control conditions (tanks) and in the field (ponds), the DNA detectability decreases with time after the removal of the species source of DNA. DNA was detectable for less than one month in both conditions. The density of individuals also influences the dynamics of DNA detectability in water samples. The dynamics of detectability reflects the persistence of DNA fragments in freshwater ecosystems. The short time persistence of detectable amounts of DNA opens perspectives in conservation biology, by allowing access to the presence or absence of species e.g. rare, secretive, potentially invasive, or at low density. This knowledge of DNA persistence will greatly influence planning of biodiversity inventories and biosecurity surveys.},

However, relatively few studies have been conducted on its hydrology, as compared to other great rivers such as the Amazon, Nile, Yangtze, or Mississippi. The goal of this study is therefore to help fill this gap and provide the first high-resolution simulation of the Congo river-estuary-coastal sea continuum. To this end, we are using a discontinuous-Galerkin finite element marine model that solves the two-dimensional depth-averaged shallow water equations on an unstructured mesh. To ensure a smooth transition from river to coastal sea, we have considered a model that encompasses both hydrological and coastal ocean processes. An important difficulty in setting up this model was to find data to parameterize and validate it, as it is a rather remote and understudied area. Therefore, an important effort in this study has been to establish a methodology to take advantage of all the data sources available including nautical charts that had to be digitalized. The model surface elevation has then been validated with respect to an altimetric database. Model results suggest the existence of gyres in the vicinity of the river mouth that have never been documented before. The effect of those gyres on the Congo River dynamics has been further investigated by simulating the transport of Lagrangian particles and computing the water age. {\&}copy; 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Animals are often faced with complex movement decisions, particularly those that involve long-distance dispersal. Partial migrations, ubiquitous among all groups of vertebrates, are a form of long-distance movement that occurs when only some of the animals in a population migrate. The decision to migrate or to be a resident can be dependent on many factors, but these factors are rarely quantified in fishes, particularly top predators, even though partial migrations may have important implications for ecosystem dynamics and conservation. We utilized passive acoustic telemetry, with a Brownian bridge movement model and generalized additive mixed models, to explore the factors regulating partial migration in a large marine predator, the tiger shark, throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Although sharks tended to utilize a particular "core" island, they also demonstrated inter-island movements, particularly mature females that would swim from the northwestern Hawaiian Islands to the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). Immigration to another island was a function of season, sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll a concentration. Our results predict that 25{\%} of mature females moved from remote French Frigate Shoals atoll to the MHI during late summer/early fall, potentially to give birth. Females with core home ranges within the MHI showed limited movements to the NWHI, and immigration to an island was better explained by SST and chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting a foraging function. Dispersal patterns in tiger sharks are complex but can be considered a mix of skipped-breeding partial migration by mature females and individual-based inter-island movements potentially linked to foraging. Therefore, sharks appear to use a conditional strategy based on fixed intrinsic and flexible extrinsic states. The application of Brownian bridge movement models to electronic presence/absence data provides a new technique for assessing the influence of habitat and environmental conditions on patterns of movement for fish populations.},

abstract = {Flowering and fruiting as phenological events of 12 tree species in an evergreen tropical mountain rain forest in southern Ecuador were examined over a period of 3-4 years. Leaf shedding of two species was observed for 12 months. Parallel to the phenological recordings, meteorological parameters were monitored in detail and related to the flowering and fruiting activity of the trees. In spite of the perhumid climate of that area, a high degree of intra- and inter-specific synchronisation of phenological traits was apparent. With the exception of one species that flowered more or less continuously, two groups of trees could be observed, one of which flowered during the less humid months (September to October) while the second group started to initiate flowers towards the end of that phase and flowered during the heavy rains (April to July). As reflected by correlation coefficients, the all-time series of meteorological parameters showed a distinct seasonality of 8-12 months, apparently following the quasi-periodic oscillation of precipitation and related cloudiness. As revealed by power spectrum analysis and Markov persistence, rainfall and minimum temperature appear to be the only parameters with a periodicity free of long-term variations. The phenological events of most of the plant species showed a similar periodicity of 8-12 months, which followed the annual oscillation of relatively less and more humid periods and thus was in phase or in counter-phase with the oscillations of the meteorological parameters. Periods of unusual cold or dryness, presumably resulting from underlying longer-term trends or oscillations (such as ENSO), affected the homogeneity of quasi-12-month flowering events, fruit maturation and also the production of germinable seeds. Some species show underlying quasi-2-year-oscillations, for example that synchronise with the development of air temperature; others reveal an underlying decrease or increase in flowering activity over the observation period, influenced for instance by solar irradiance. As Ecuador suffers the highest rate of deforestation in South America, there is an urgent need for indigenous plant material for reforestation. A detailed knowledge of the biology of reproduction in relation to governing external factors (mainly climate) is thus required.},

abstract = {Laboratory soil pans and rainfall simulators have been used to study fundamental erosion processes affecting interrill soil loss. Problems exist when laboratory results are extended to those determined under field conditions. Experimental methodology influences a soil's interrill erodibility and interrill erodibility ranking among soils. We compared interrill soil loss and erodibility data from two erosion pans with field data from identical soils. Three plot size-rainfall simulator methodologies were used: (1) 0.14-m2 lab pan under a constant drop size (4.6 mm) rainfall simulator, (2) 0.32-m2 lab pan with soil border areas under an oscillating nozzle (2.3 mm median drop diameter) rainfall simulator, and (3) 1-m2 field plots under the same rainfall simulator as used in Method 2. Soil loss was measured at 5-min intervals. Interrill erodibility (Ki) was calculated from two equations (E = KiiI2 and E = KiqIq) using measured soil loss (E), rainfall intensity (I), and flow discharge (q) values. The interrill erosion equation, methodology, time, and initial water content influenced calculated Ki values. Soil loss and Ki values from Method 1 did not correlate with and were greater than corresponding values from Methods 2 and 3. Soil loss and Ki values from Method 2 were correlated (r = 0.56 to 0.79) with corresponding values from Method 3. The Kiq values decreased with time and were a function of soil properties related to soil detachment and sediment transport. The Kii values (i) increased with time, (ii) were primarily a function of soil properties related to soil detachment only, and (iii) did not account for infiltration and runoff differences among soils.},

Here, we review the current state of knowledge about physiological and ecological responses, with the aim of providing a framework that can help to guide future experimental research. Modelling studies have indicated that elevated ca can potentially stimulate photosynthesis more in the tropics than at higher latitudes, because suppression of photorespiration by elevated ca increases with temperature. However, canopy leaves in tropical forests could also potentially reach a high temperature threshold under elevated ca that will moderate the rise in photosynthesis. Belowground responses, including fine root production, nutrient foraging and soil organic matter processing, will be especially important to the integrated ecosystem response to elevated ca. Water use efficiency will increase as ca rises, potentially impacting upon soil moisture status and nutrient availability. Recruitment may be differentially altered for some functional groups, potentially decreasing ecosystem carbon storage. Whole-forest CO2 enrichment experiments are urgently needed to test predictions of tropical forest functioning under elevated ca. Smaller scale experiments in the understorey and in gaps would also be informative, and could provide stepping stones towards stand-scale manipulations.},

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

abstract = {Tropical tree height-diameter (H:D) relationships may vary by forest type and region making large-scale estimates of above-ground biomass subject to bias if they ignore these differences in stem allometry. We have therefore developed a new global tropical forest database consisting of 39 955 concurrent H and D measurements encompassing 283 sites in 22 tropical countries. Utilising this database, our objectives were: 1. to determine if H:D relationships differ by geographic region and forest type (wet to dry forests, including zones of tension where forest and savanna overlap). 2. to ascertain if the H:D relationship is modulated by climate and/or forest structural characteristics (e.g. stand-level basal area, A). 3. to develop H:D allometric equations and evaluate biases to reduce error in future local-to-global estimates of tropical forest biomass. Annual precipitation coefficient of variation (P-V), dry season length (S-D), and mean annual air temperature (T-A) emerged as key drivers of variation in H:D relationships at the pantropical and region scales. Vegetation structure also played a role with trees in forests of a high A being, on average, taller at any given D. After the effects of environment and forest structure are taken into account, two main regional groups can be identified. Forests in Asia, Africa and the Guyana Shield all have, on average, similar H:D relationships, but with trees in the forests of much of the Amazon Basin and tropical Australia typically being shorter at any given D than their counterparts elsewhere. The region-environment-structure model with the lowest Akaike's information criterion and lowest deviation estimated stand-level H across all plots to within a median -2.7 to 0.9{\%} of the true value. Some of the plot-to-plot variability in H:D relationships not accounted for by this model could be attributed to variations in soil physical conditions. Other things being equal, trees tend to be more slender in the absence of soil physical constraints, especially at smaller D. Pantropical and continental-level models provided less robust estimates of H, especially when the roles of climate and stand structure in modulating H:D allometry were not simultaneously taken into account.},

Results show that water-distance-based kriging performed just as well as, and in most cases better than, a kriging method based on Euclidean distance. Benefits of the water-distance-based method with kriging include improved estimates in regions with complex geometry and lower uncertainty in the kriging predictions.},

These have led to a greater appreciation of the key role played by the time dependency of the length of the salt intrusion. Improved realism in simplified tidally averaged physics has been driven by simultaneous advances in our understanding of the detailed dynamics within the tidal cycle and across irregular channel cross-sections. The complex interactions of turbulence, stratification, and advection are now understood well enough to motivate a new generation of physically plausible mixing parameterizations for the tidally averaged equations.},

abstract = {Few measurements for carbon sequestration, ratio of above-ground to below-ground biomass and wood density exist for young trees. Current allometric models are mostly for mature trees, and few consider trees at the sapling stage. Over four years we monitored the growth rates, from seedling to the sapling stage, of 490 trees (five native species) in environmental plantings, in the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Australia. Our biomass estimates were greater by several orders of magnitude in the first year (6× 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Mgha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cf. 4× 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Mgha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), and two orders of magnitude less at four years than those derived from the national carbon accounting model (5× 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Mgha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cf. 13Mgha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). We destructively sampled 37 young trees to accurately estimate the variation in below-ground and above-ground biomass (AGB) with stem size, and to derive a best fit model for predicting sapling biomass: lnAGB=-5.092+0.786 ln(Diam.{\textless}inf{\textgreater}base{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}){\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Height. Biomass expansion factors for young tree species ranged from 1.71 to 2.44, higher than average for tropical forests. Root:shoot ratios are consistent with mean estimates for mature rainforest. Stem wood densities ranged from 0.444 to 0.683Mgm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for the five species measured, which was 6.5{\%} lower than published estimates for three of the species, and 12{\%} and 27{\%} higher for two species. Relative growth rates were faster for species with lower wood density in the first four years, but these species also had the lowest survival over the same period. The findings are significant for a number of reasons. Ecologically, they indicate that young rainforest trees invest more in leaves and branches than in stem growth. From a survival perspective, in the context of rainforest restoration, it is best to invest in species with higher wood densities. From a carbon accounting point of view, refinements to the models used for national carbon accounting are required that include the contribution of the sapling stage. Sapling growth rates were significantly different from those assumed in the national model, requiring growth rates to be increased after four years (as opposed to after 2years in the national model) before reaching an asymptote at some time in the future. This adjustment is essential to enable carbon farmers to judge the time it takes to receive returns from investment. Policies that encourage carbon plantings should take into account that young plantings grow slower than predicted by current national carbon accounting models.},

abstract = {Modelling is an effective tool to investigate the ecological state of water resources. In developing countries, the impact of sanitation infrastructures (e.g. wastewater treatment plants) is typically assessed considering the achievement of legal physicochemical quality standards, but ignoring the ecological water quality (EWQ) of the receiving river. In this paper, we developed a generic integrated ecological modelling framework quantifying the impact of wastewater discharges on the EWQ of the Cauca river (Colombia). The framework is flexible enough to be used in conjunction with different approaches/models and integrates a hydraulic and physicochemical water quality model with aquatic ecological models. Two types of ecological models were developed, habitat suitability models for selected macroinvertebrate groups and ecological assessment models based on a macroinvertebrate biotic index. Four pollution control scenarios were tested. It was found that the foreseen investments in sanitation infrastructure will lead to modest improvements of the EWQ, with an increase lower than six units of the ecological index BMWP-Colombia. Advanced investments, such as the collection and treatment of all wastewater produced by the cities of Cali, Yumbo and Palmira and upgrading of the treatment systems should be considered to achieve a good EWQ. The results show that the integration of ecological models in hydraulic and physicochemical water quality models (e.g. MIKE 11) has an added value for decision support in river management and water policy. The integration of models is a key aspect for the success in environmental decision making. The main limitation of this approach is the availability of physicochemical, hydraulic and biological data that are collected simultaneously. Therefore, a change in the river monitoring strategy towards collection of data which include simultaneous measurements of these variables is required. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hughes2007,
abstract = {1. The ‘Field of Dreams Hypothesis' states ‘if we build it, they will come', referring to the assumption that if habitats are restored, species will recolonise them. However, the ability of a species to recolonise a restored site will depend not only on the appropriate habitat being present, but also on the ability to get there. This is likely to depend on both the species' dispersal behaviour and the position of a site in the landscape. 2. Animals with good potential for dispersal are more likely to be able to disperse to newly restored sites. Similarly, sites in lowland streams with limited altitudinal differences between sites may be easier to reach than upstream sites. This is because upstream sites are connected to one another via lowland streams that have different characteristics and therefore may be difficult for animals to traverse. 3. In this paper, genetic data from a range of freshwater species that have been analysed in my laboratory are used to assess the importance of life cycle and position in the landscape (i.e. upland versus lowland streams) on connectivity patterns (and thus recolonisation potential) among populations. 4. In general, contemporary dispersal across catchment boundaries is negligible, except for aquatic insects with an adult flight stage. Dispersal among streams within catchments appears to be more limited than was predicted from knowledge on life histories, except for fish in lowland rivers and streams. 5. As predicted, dispersal of fish, crustaceans and molluscs among streams within catchments is significantly greater in lowland rivers than in upland streams. 6. Overall, these analyses suggest that, with the exception of most insects, and fishes in lowland rivers, natural recolonisation of restored sites is only likely from sites within the same stream. If a species has disappeared from the whole stream, then restoration of habitat alone may not be sufficient for its re-establishment.},

abstract = {Symbiotic dinitrogen (N(2)) fixation is often invoked to explain the N richness of tropical forests as ostensibly N(2)-fixing trees can be a major component of the community. Such arguments assume N(2) fixers are fixing N when present. However, in laboratory experiments, legumes consistently reduce N(2) fixation in response to increased soil N availability. These contrasting views of N(2) fixation as either obligate or facultative have drastically different implications for the N cycle of tropical forests. We tested these models by directly measuring N(2)-fixing root nodules and nitrogenase activity of individual canopy-dominant legume trees (Inga sp.) across several lowland forest types. Fixation was substantial in disturbed forests and some gaps but near zero in the high N soils of mature forest. Our findings suggest that canopy legumes closely regulate N(2) fixation, leading to large variations in N inputs across the landscape, and low symbiotic fixation in mature forests despite abundant legumes.},

abstract = {Niche theory is a well-established concept integrating a diverse array of biophysical variables and multispecies interactions used to describe species geographic distribution. While it is now customary to employ species distribution models (SDMs) that use biophysical variables in conjunction with species location information to map their geographic ranges, the challenge remains to account for the biotic interactions of species with other community members on which they depend. Our aim was to illuminate the connection between species spatial distribution and their dependence with other species by modeling spatially explicit predator-prey interactions, which we call a trophic interaction distribution model (TIDM). To develop the principles we report here, we capitalized on data from a Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) reintroduction in Colorado. Spatial location information of lynx obtained using telemetry in conjunction with coarse resolution biophysical data were used to construct a SDM. The spatial locations of lynx-snowshoe hare encounters obtained from ground-tracking in conjunction with coarse resolution biophysical data were used to construct a TIDM. The biophysical conditions associated with lynx locations and lynx-hare encounters identified through both SDM and TIDM revealed an initial transient phase in habitat use that settled into a steady state. Nevertheless, despite the potential for the SDM to broadly encompass all lynx hunting and non-hunting spatial locations, the spatial extents of the SDM and TIDM greatly diverged; about 40{\%} of important lynx-snowshoe hare locations identified in the TIDM were not identified in the lynx-only SDM. Our results encourage greater effort to quantify spatial locations of trophic interactions among species in a community and the associated biophysical conditions when attempting to construct models aimed at projecting current and future species geographic distributions.},

abstract = {Whole-rock geochemical data on basaltic to rhyolitic samples from 12 volcanic centers are used to constrain the role of continental crust in the genesis of magmas formed beneath the anomalously wide subduction-related volcanic arc in Ecuador. Relatively homogeneous, mantle-like, isotopic compositions across the arc imply that the parental magmas in Ecuador were produced largely within the mantle wedge above the subduction zone and not by extensive melting of crustal rocks similar to those upon which the volcanoes were built. Cross-arc changes in 143Nd/144Nd and {\{}Delta{\}}7/4Pb are interpreted to result from assimilation of geochemically mature continental crust, especially in the main arc area, 330-360 km from the trench. Mixing calculations limit the quantity of assimilated crust to less than [{\~{}}]10{\%}. Most andesites and dacites in Ecuador have adakite-like trace element characteristics (e.g. Y {\textless}18 ppm, Yb {\textless}2 ppm, La/Yb {\textgreater}20, Sr/Y {\textgreater}40). Available whole-rock data do not provide a clear basis for distinguishing between slab-melting and deep crustal fractionation models for the genesis of Ecuador adakites; published data highlighting geochemical evolution within individual volcanoes, and in magmatic rocks produced throughout Ecuador since the Eocene, appear to support the deep fractionation model for the genesis of most evolved Ecuadoran lavas.

abstract = {The value of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for assessing climate change impacts on crop productivity cannot be over-emphasised. This study evaluated a GIS based methodology for teff (Eragrostis tef) production in Ethiopia. We examined the spatial implications of climate change on areas suitable for teff, and estimated the effects of altered environments on teff's productivity. There was a non-linear relationship between suitability indices, the output of spatial analysis and teff yield data collected from diverse ecological zones. This served as the basis for country-wide crop yield analysis for both current and future climate scenarios. To complement this effort, a socio-economic survey was carried with a thrust of understanding the agricultural activities in the study area. With the current climatic conditions, 87.7{\%} of Ethiopia is suitable for teff. On the other hand, approximately 67.7{\%} of Ethiopia is expected to be suitable for teff production by 2050. Suitability index (SI) and the actual crop yield data showed a strong positive correlation (r = 74{\%}). There is a predicted severe drop in teff yield (-0.46t ha-1) by the year 2050. Based on the current area under teff in Ethiopia, this equals an overall reduction in national production of about 1,190,784.12 t, equivalent to a loss of US{\$} 651 million to farmers. The results indicate that crop yield varied significantly as a function of climatic variation and that the model is applicable in assessing the impact of climate change on crop productivity at various levels taking into consideration spatial variability of climate.

abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

abstract = {Amphibians face an unprecedented crisis. One-third of more than the 6500 species described in the world are today threatened by extinction. One of the proximal factors of this decline is an emergent infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This fungus develops on the keratin of amphibians (buccal parts of tadpoles, skin of juveniles and adults). By now, it has been detected on 387 species in 45 countries, with mass mortalities in at least 7 of them. There are two main non-exclusive hypotheses to explain the recent emergence of chytridiomycosis: 1) this fungus was recently introduced into new geographical areas (via increased international trade and invasive species) and would lead to the death of native species sensitive to the pathogen, 2) this fungus would be naturally widespread and its virulence and$\backslash$or the susceptibility of amphibian species would vary according to environmental conditions (in connection with climate change or synergy with other factors such as pollutants). In France, B. dendrobatidis was identified on one reservoir species of the fungus in its natural range: the American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus). In 2006, this fungus was associated with massive mortality of amphibians in the French Pyr{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}es. This paper aims to present the main biological features of B. dendrobatidis and the current epidemiological knowledge, the acquisition of which is still in its initial phase in Europe.},

abstract = {This article reviews literature and summarizes experiments to investigate the extent lu which productivity of tropical montane rain forests is constrained by low nutrient supply, On any one mountain, with increase in altitude foliar N decreases, and P and K usually decrease, but Ca and Rig show no consistent trend. However for a wide range of sites N P, K, Mg, and Ca show no trends. Litterfall contents of N and P and often K, Ca, and Mg are lower in montane forests than in lowland forests, mainly because of reduced litterfall mass, but N and P concentrations are also lower in forests above 1500 m. Tropical montane soils usually have more soil organic matter per unit ground area; N mineralization levels are lower at higher altitudes in Costa Rica, and extractable and total soil P are lower in sites with lower litterfall P concentration. We speculate that many lowland forests are limited by P and manu montane forests by N. Fertilization studies on ash-derived montane soils in Hawaii showed a trend for a switch from N limitation on young soils to P, or N and P, limitation on soils over older substrates. Jamaican montane trees were limited by N and by P separately. Venezuelan montane trees were limited by N. The sites in Jamaica and Venezuela have soils of indeterminate age. Taken together these results show that nutrient limitation is widespread in montane soils (all sites have responded to at least one nutrient) and that the particular nutrient(s) that limit(s) production may differ for explicable reasons, First results from lowland forests on sandy soils in Kalimantan show N or simultaneous N and P limitation. Many more experiments, especially in lowland forests, are needed to test our speculation that P usually limits productivity in tropical lowland rain forests and that N limits productivity in tropical montane rain forests.},

abstract = {The depth to which plants locate their roots has important but yet poorly understood implications with regard to the profile distribution and dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC). We compared the profile distribution of fine root biomass (FRB) with depth distribution of SOC, based on data recalculated from published literature. Mechanisms through which roots might contribute to long-term storage of SOC were reviewed. There was general agreement across previous studies that over 60{\%} of SOC were in the top 0.3 m of soil, where FRB was concentrated. However, studies in which depth distribution of SOC was simultaneously compared to profile distribution of RB were not readily available, suggesting that this area of research has received limited attention. There is a paucity of empirical evidence to lend support to theorised mechanisms through which roots stabilise SOC. The relationship between profile distribution of roots and depth distribution of SOC must be evaluated on-site for defined landuses. A standardised format for presenting results must be developed and agreed upon to ease interpretation of the results. National Soil Science Societies may have a significant role in this process and this 19th World Congress of Soil Science will be an opportune assembly for dialogue.},

abstract = {Background: The slopes of the eastern Andes harbour some of the highest biodiversity on Earth and a high proportion of endemic species. However, there have been only a few and limited descriptions of carbon budgets in tropical montane forest regions. Aims: We present the first comprehensive data on the production, allocation and cycling of carbon for two high elevation (ca. 3000 m) tropical montane cloud forest plots in the Kos{\~{n}}ipata Valley, Peruvian Andes. Methods: We measured the main components and seasonal variation of net primary productivity (NPP), autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) respiration to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) in two 1-ha plots. Results: NPP for the two plots was estimated to be 7.05 ± 0.39 and 8.04 ± 0.47 Mg C ha?1 year?1, GPP to be 22.33 ± 2.23 and 26.82 ± 2.97 Mg C ha?1 year?1 and CUE was 0.32 ± 0.04 and 0.30 ± 0.04. Conclusions: We found strong seasonality in NPP and moderate seasonality of Ra, suggesting that forest NPP is driven by changes in photosynthesis and highlighting the importance of variation in solar radiation. Our findings imply that trees invest more in biomass production in the cooler season with lower solar radiation and more in maintenance during the warmer and high solar radiation period.},

@article{Cassini2011,
abstract = {Most species distribution models (SDMs) assume that habitats are closed, stable and without competition. In that environmental context, it is ecologically correct to assume that members of a species will be distributed in direct relation to the suitability of the habitat, that is, according to the so-called habitat matching rule. This paper examines whether it is possible to maintain the assumption of the habitat matching rule in the following circumstances: (1) when habitats are connected and organisms can move between them, (2) when there are disturbances and seasonal cycles that generate instability, and (3) when there is interspecific and intra-specific competition. Here I argue that it is possible as long as the following aspects are taken into account. In open habitats at equilibrium, in which habitat selection and competition operate, the habitat matching rule can be applied in some conditions, while competition tends to homogenize the species distribution in other environmental contexts. In the latter case, two methods can be used to incorporate these effects into SDMs: new parameters can be incor- porated into the response functions, or the occurrence of proportions of cate- gories of individuals (adult/young, male/female, or dominant/subordinate species in guilds) can be used instead of the occurrence of organisms. The habitat matching rule is not fulfilled in non-equilibrium environments. The solution to this problem lies in the design of SDMs with two strategies that depend on scale. Locally, the disequilibrium can be encapsulated using average environmental conditions, with sufficiently large cells (in the case of metapopulations) and/or long enough sampling periods (in the case of seasonal cycles). At coarse scales, the use of presence-only models can in some cases avoid the destabilizing effect of catastrophic historical processes. The matching law is a strong assumption of SDMs because it is based on population ecology theory and the principle of evolution by natural selection.},

Next, they address the problems of theory and conceptual framework for individual-based ecology: What is "theory"? That is, how do we develop reusable models of how system dynamics arise from characteristics of individuals? What conceptual framework do we use when the classical differential equation framework no longer applies? An extensive review illustrates the ecological problems that have been addressed with individual-based models. The authors then identify how the mechanics of building and using individual-based models differ from those of traditional science, and provide guidance on formulating, programming, and analyzing models. This book will be helpful to ecologists interested in modeling, and to other scientists interested in agent-based modeling.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are intimately linked to atmospheric CO2 levels through their significant capacity for uptake and storage of carbon (C) in biomass and soils. Increasing pressure of deforestation and forest degradation is begging the question as to what extent land use changes will affect C storage and release in tropical areas. Hitherto, many research efforts focused on aboveground C stocks in lowland tropical forests, but a considerable amount of C is stored in tropical soils as well. Some previous studies suggested that soil C storage increases with increasing altitude, while others found no relation with altitude. In this study, we addressed this controversy by quantifying soil organic C (SOC) stocks along an altitudinal gradient spanning a 3000m altitude difference. In addition, we sampled soils in anthropogenic grasslands in proximity to forests at different altitudes to provide information on effects of land use change. Soil was sampled on 92 forest locations down to 100cm depth in forest plots, and down to 30cm in 13 grassland plots. We found that forest SOC stocks varied predictably with altitude in our study area, ranging between 4.8 and 19.4kgCm-2 and increasing by 5.1kgCm-2 per 1000m increase in altitude. Soil properties (pH, bulk density, depth) and soil forming processes played an important role in this relationship with altitude. SOC stocks were not significantly different between forests and grasslands along the gradient in our study, due to a higher soil density in grasslands. When grassland SOC stocks were corrected for this difference in soil density, forest soils contained a significantly greater amount of C. In addition, while this difference was negligible at low altitudes, it tended to increase with increasing altitude. This study suggests that montane tropical forest soils consistently contain larger amounts of C compared to lowland tropical forests, and that conversion of forest to grasslands at higher altitudes might lead to larger soil C losses than previously expected. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We measured CO2 efflux from stems of seven subtropical tree species situated along an elevational gradient in the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico and scaled these measurements up to the landscape level based on modeled and empirical relations. The most important determinants of ecosystem stem respiration were species composition and stem temperature. At a species scale, measured CO2 efflux per unit bole surface area at a given temperature was highest in the early successional species Cecropia schreberiana and lowest in species that inhabit high elevations such as Micropholis garciniifolia and Tabebuia rigida. Carbon dioxide efflux rates followed a diel pattern that lagged approximately 6h behind changes in sapwood temperatures. At an ecosystem scale, our simulation model indicates a decreasing trend of stem respiration rates with increasing elevation due to shifts in species composition, lower temperatures and reductions in branch surface area. The highest estimated stem respiration rates were present in the lowland tabonuco forest type and the lowest rates were present in the elfin forest type (mean 7.4 and 2.1MgCha−1yr−1, respectively). There was slight temperature-induced seasonal variation in simulated stem respiration rates at low elevations, with a maximum difference of 19{\%} between the months of February and July.

abstract = {Uncertainty in biomass estimates is one of the greatest limitations to models of carbon flux in tropical forests. Previous comparisons of field-based estimates of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of trees greater than 10 cm diameter within Amazonia have been limited by the paucity of data for western Amazon forests, and the use of site-specific methods to estimate biomass from inventory data. In addition, the role of regional variation in stand-level wood specific gravity has not previously been considered. Using data from 56 mature forest plots across Amazonia, we consider the relative roles of species composition (wood specific gravity) and forest structure (basal area) in determining variation in AGB. Mean stand-level wood specific gravity, on a per stem basis, is 15.8{\%} higher in forests in central and eastern, compared with northwestern Amazonia. This pattern is due to the higher diversity and abundance of taxa with high specific gravity values in central and eastern Amazonia, and the greater diversity and abundance of taxa with low specific gravity values in western Amazonia. For two estimates of AGB derived using different allometric equations, basal area explains 51.7{\%} and 63.4{\%}, and stand-level specific gravity 45.4{\%} and 29.7{\%}, of the total variation in AGB. The variation in specific gravity is important because it determines the regional scale, spatial pattern of AGB. When weighting by specific gravity is included, central and eastern Amazon forests have significantly higher AGB than stands in northwest or southwest Amazonia. The regional-scale pattern of species composition therefore defines a broad gradient of AGB across Amazonia.},

abstract = {Proper management of soil organic matter (SOM) is needed for maintaining soil fertility and for mitigation of the global increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and should be informed by knowledge about the sources, spatial organisation and stabilisation processes of SOM. Recently, microbial biomass residues (i.e. necromass) have been identified as a significant source of SOM. Here, we propose that cell wall envelopes of bacteria and fungi are stabilised in soil and contribute significantly to small-particulate SOM formation. This hypothesis is based on the mass balance of a soil incubation experiment with C-13-labelled bacterial cells and on the visualisation of the microbial residues by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the end of a 224-day incubation, 50{\%} of the biomass-derived C remained in the soil, mainly in the non-living part of SOM (40{\%} of the added biomass C). SEM micrographs only rarely showed intact cells. Instead, organic patchy fragments of 200-500 nm size were abundant and these fragments were associated with all stages of cell envelope decay and fragmentation. Similar fragments, developed on initially clean and sterile in situ microcosms during exposure to groundwater, provide clear evidence for their formation during microbial growth and surface colonisation. Microbial cell envelope fragments thus contribute significantly to SOM formation. This origin and the related macromolecular architecture of SOM are consistent with most observations on SOM, including the abundance of microbial-derived biomarkers, the low C/N ratio, the water repellency and the stabilisation of biomolecules, which in theory should be easily degradable.},

However, this apparent up-regulation of the ecosystem N cycle introduces a biogeochemical paradox when considered from the perspective of physiology and evolution of individual plants: The putative source for tropical N richness-symbiotic N fixation-should, in theory, be physiologically down-regulated as internal pools of bioavailable N build. We review the evidence for tropical N richness and evaluate several hypotheses that may explain its emergence and maintenance. We propose a leaky nitrostat model that is capable of resolving the paradox at scales of both ecosystems and individual N-fixing organisms.},

abstract = {Nearly every aspect of the cloud forest is affected by regular cloud immersion, from the hydrological cycle to the species of plants and animals within the forest. Since the altitude band of cloud formation on tropical mountains is limited, the tropical montane cloud forest occurs in fragmented strips and has been likened to island archipelagoes. This isolation and uniqueness promotes explosive speciation, exceptionally high endemism, and a great sensitivity to climate. Global climate change threatens all ecosystems through temperature and rainfall changes, with a typical estimate for altitude shifts in the climatic optimum for mountain ecotones of hundreds of meters by the time of CO2 doubling. This alone suggests complete replacement of many of the narrow altitude range cloud forests by lower altitude ecosystems, as well as the expulsion of peak residing cloud forests into extinction. However, the cloud forest will also be affected by other climate changes, in particular changes in cloud formation. A number of global climate models suggest a reduction in low level cloudiness with the coming climate changes, and one site in particular, Monteverde, Costa Rica, appears to already be experiencing a reduction in cloud immersion. The coming climate changes appear very likely to upset the current dynamic equilibrium of the cloud forest. Results will include biodiversity loss, altitude shifts in species' ranges and subsequent community reshuffling, and possibly forest death. Difficulties for cloud forest species to survive in climate-induced migrations include no remaining location with a suitable climate, no pristine location to colonize, migration rates or establishment rates that cannot keep up with climate change rates and new species interactions. We review previous cloud forest species redistributions in the paleo-record in light of the coming changes. The characteristic epiphytes of the cloud forest play an important role in the light, hydrological and nutrient cycles of the cloud forest and are especially sensitive to atmospheric climate change, especially humidity, as the epiphytes can occupy incredibly small eco-niches from the canopy to crooks to trunks. Even slight shifts in climate can cause wilting or death to the epiphyte community. Similarly, recent cloud forest animal redistributions, notably frog and lizard disappearances, may be driven by climate changes. Death of animals or epiphytes may have cascading effects on the cloud forest web of life. Aside from changes in temperature, precipitation, and cloudiness, other climate changes may include increasing dry seasons, droughts, hurricanes and intense rain storms, all of which might increase damage to the cloud forest. Because cloud forest species occupy such small areas and tight ecological niches, they are not likely to colonize damaged regions. Fire, drought and plant invasions (especially non-native plants) are likely to increase the effects of any climate change damage in the cloud forest. As has frequently been suggested in the literature, all of the above factors combine to make the cloud forest a likely site for observing climate change effects in the near future.

Measuring or monitoring habitat quality requires complex integration of many properties of the ecosystem, where traditional terrestrial data collection methods have proven extremely time-demanding. Remote sensing has known potential to map various ecosystem properties, also allowing rigorous checking of accuracy and supporting standardized processing. Our Special Issue presents examples where remote sensing has been successfully used for habitat mapping, quantification of habitat quality parameters, or multi-parameter modelling of habitat quality itself. New frontiers such as bathymetric scanning, grassland vegetation classification and operational use were explored, various new ecological verification methods were introduced and integration with ongoing habitat conservation schemes was demonstrated. These studies show that remote sensing and Geoinformation Science for habitat quality analysis have evolved from isolated experimental studies to an active field of research with a dedicated community. It is expected that these new methods will substantially contribute to biodiversity conservation worldwide.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Tropical forestry is often not competitive with agricultural land uses such as pasture for cattle ranching. Additional revenues from carbon sequestration generated by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol can change this situation. In three different zones of north-western Ecuador, minimum compensation payments for carbon sequestration were determined, which would make reforestation a feasible land-use alternative. Based on our findings that these minimum prices depend on the net benefit of the respective land-use alternatives, and on the accounting regimes for CDM sink projects, we applied the accounting rules for temporary and long-term Certified Emission Reductions (CER) to two reforestation projects: forest plantation and natural regrowth of secondary forest. A comparison of these alternatives showed that secondary forest is an attractive alternative under both accounting regimes because of its low establishment costs and relative early timber revenues. After identifying the zone most suitable for carbon sink projects, we calculated net benefits of land-use changes in the event that certain prices for emission reductions were actually paid. We found that secondary forest becomes economically attractive, if the price of permanent credits is above {\$}4.5/tCO2, whereas forest plantations require permanent CER prices of {\$}7.0/tCO2. In both cases, the results are within the price margins forecasted by various institutions for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The presented methodology is meant to support the decision making process on the supply side of a future CER market. Opportunity costs of land-use changes have to be analyzed carefully before deciding in favor of long binding forestry projects. Assigning temporary credits to naturally regrown secondary forests could-although excluded from CDM during the first commitment period-combine the advantages of a flexible accounting regime with the positive economic and ecological effects of this competitive land use. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To date, we lack an integrated framework that identifies environmental factors that control eDNA movement in realistic, complex, and heterogeneous flowing waters. To this end, using an empirical approach and a simple conceptual model, we propose a framework of how eDNA is transported, retained, and resuspended in stream systems. Such an understanding of eDNA dispersal in streams will be essential for designing optimized sampling protocols and subsequently estimating biomass or organismal abundance. We also discuss guiding principles for more effective use of eDNA methods, highlighting the necessity of understanding these parameters for use in future predictive modeling of eDNA transport.},

Game theory can address feedbacks but does not provide foraging theory for unique individuals in variable environments.

The study site is located at 1200-1300 m asl in the Fortuna forest reserve in western Panama and has a mature, mixed-species stand growing on an Andisol soil. Control and N-fertilized (1.25 kg urea-N ha(-1) y(-1)) treatments were represented by four replicate plots (each 40 x 40 in, separated by at least 40 in). Stem diameter growth was analysed by diameter at breast height classes and also for the three most abundant species. The three species did not respond to N addition. The response of stem growth and above-ground woody biomass production to N fertilization varied among dbh classes. Stem growth of trees of 10-30 cm dbh increased only in the first: year of N addition while trees of 30-50 cm dbh responded in the second year of N addition, which may be due to differences in light conditions between years. Trees {\textgreater} 50 cm dbh did not respond during 2 years of N addition. As a result, the overall stem growth and above-ground woody biomass production were not affected by N fertilization. Annual total fine litterfall increased in the first year of N fertilization, while annual leaf litterfall increased in both years of N addition. Above-ground net primary production, of which total tine litterfall constituted 68{\%}, also increased only in the first year of N addition. The magnitude and timing of response of stem diameter growth and litterfall suggest that these aspects of above-ground productivity are not uniformly limited by N availability.},

abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) have been identified in 736 sites in 59 countries. The important role of TMCF in sustaining the livelihoods of local populations by protecting watersheds and sustaining unpolluted freshwater sources has been generally recognised. Cloud forests are important sources of non-timber forest products and are an essential habitat for many endemic and threatened plant and animal species. During the past 20 years, cloud forests worldwide have been disappearing rapidly. They are facing considerable localised threats from clearance and further fragmentation, as a result of population pressure, unsustainable harvesting and poor management practices. External pressures such as mining, road building, air pollution and global warming further exacerbate the problem. Converting TMCF to other uses almost invariably affects water quality, and may significantly reduce water availability further downstream. Sustainable management and conservation of cloud forests faces many challenges including population pressure, poor awareness of their value and the lack of reliable information, political will and donor assistance. However, various successful conservation and sustainable use projects illustrate the potential of a range of approaches to cloud forest conservation. Furthermore, networks and initiatives are promoting cloud forest conservation at local, national, regional and global levels. Much hope is being placed in the International Year of the Mountain and Rio +10 to raise awareness and encourage donors, governments, businesses, NGO's and local communities to conserve the cloud forests that still remain.},

abstract = {Monitoring and predicting the biogeochemical state of the ocean and marine ecosystems is an important application of operational oceanography that needs to be expanded. The accurate depiction of the ocean's physical environment enabled by Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) systems, in both real-time and reanalysis modes, is already valuable for various applications, such as the fishing industry and fisheries management. However, most of these applications require accurate estimates of both physical and biogeochemical ocean conditions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we discuss recent developments that enable coupling new biogeochemical models and assimilation components with the existing GODAE systems, and we examine the potential of such systems in several areas of interest: phytoplankton biomass monitoring in the open ocean, ocean carbon cycle monitoring and assessment, marine ecosystem management at seasonal and longer time scales, and downscaling in coastal areas. A number of key requirements and research priorities are then identified for the future. GODAE systems will need to improve their representation of physical variables that are not yet considered essential, such as upper-ocean vertical fluxes that are critically important to biological activity. Further, the observing systems will need to be expanded in terms of in situ platforms (with intensified deployments of sensors for O2 and chlorophyll, and inclusion of new sensors for nutrients, zooplankton, micronekton biomass, and others), satellite missions (e.g., hyperspectral instruments for ocean color, lidar systems for mixed-layer depths, and wide-swath altimeters for coastal sea levels), and improved methods to assimilate these new measurements},

abstract = {This contribution proposes the meta-ecosystem concept as a natural extension of the metapopulation and metacommunity concepts. A meta-ecosystem is defined as a set of ecosystems connected by spatial flows of energy, materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries. This concept provides a powerful theoretical tool to understand the emergent properties that arise from spatial coupling of local ecosystems, such as global source-sink constraints, diversity-productivity patterns, stabilization of ecosystem processes and indirect interactions at landscape or regional scales. The meta-ecosystem perspective thereby has the potential to integrate the perspectives of community and landscape ecology, to provide novel fundamental insights into the dynamics and functioning of ecosystems from local to global scales, and to increase our ability to predict the consequences of land-use changes on biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to human societies.},

abstract = {Proper management of soil organic matter (SOM) is needed for maintaining soil fertility and for mitigation of the global increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and should be informed by knowledge about the sources, spatial organisation and stabilisation processes of SOM. Recently, microbial biomass residues (i.e. necromass) have been identified as a significant source of SOM. Here, we propose that cell wall envelopes of bacteria and fungi are stabilised in soil and contribute significantly to small-particulate SOM formation. This hypothesis is based on the mass balance of a soil incubation experiment with C-13-labelled bacterial cells and on the visualisation of the microbial residues by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the end of a 224-day incubation, 50{\%} of the biomass-derived C remained in the soil, mainly in the non-living part of SOM (40{\%} of the added biomass C). SEM micrographs only rarely showed intact cells. Instead, organic patchy fragments of 200-500 nm size were abundant and these fragments were associated with all stages of cell envelope decay and fragmentation. Similar fragments, developed on initially clean and sterile in situ microcosms during exposure to groundwater, provide clear evidence for their formation during microbial growth and surface colonisation. Microbial cell envelope fragments thus contribute significantly to SOM formation. This origin and the related macromolecular architecture of SOM are consistent with most observations on SOM, including the abundance of microbial-derived biomarkers, the low C/N ratio, the water repellency and the stabilisation of biomolecules, which in theory should be easily degradable.},

abstract = {(1) Surface soils (0-15 cm) were collected from six sites in mature undisturbed tropical rain forest along an altitudinal transect (100 m-2600 m) on Volcan Barva, Costa Rica. The rates of nitrogen-mineralization and nitrification were measured under (a) field conditions, where the soils were incubated under the litter layer, and (b) laboratory conditions, where the incubations were done at higher temperatures, but at field moisture content. In addition, a measure of nitrogen-mineralization was made under `improved' conditions, where the incubation temperature was increased, and aeration and moisture content improved. The moisture content, pH and the concentrations of a range of soil nutrients were also measured for each soil. A nutrient amendment experiment was also done, where selected nutrients were added to soils from three altitudes (100 m, 1000 m and 2600 m), and their effect on nitrogen mineralization and nitrification assessed. (2) The moisture content, total nitrogen and carbon, extractable potassium, calcium, magnesium and ammonium-nitrogen increased, and both extractable copper and nitrate-nitrogen decreased, with altitude. (3) Soil nitrogen-mineralization and nitrification both decreased with increasing altitude under field conditions, and both rates were not increased significantly by laboratory incubation, where the temperature alone was alleviated. However, where both temperature and aeration/moisture content were improved, then nitrogen-mineralization rate increased by between one and three orders of magnitude, and a positive relationship was found with altitude of origin. These combined results suggest that nitrogen-mineralization may be limited under field conditions by the high moisture contents found in the montane soils. (4) Partial correlation analysis of these nitrogen turnover rates with other measures of soil chemistry showed that (a) under `improved' conditions the mineralization rate was positively correlated with resource quality and negatively correlated with pH and perhaps reducing conditions, (b) under field and laboratory conditions the mineralization rate was correlated with the reaction product, and (c) nitrification was correlated with the reaction substrate, implying a resource limitation. (5) In the nutrient-addition experiment, ammonium-nitrogen increased nitrogen-mineralization rates at low and high altitudes, but decreased rates at the intermediate altitude. Calcium carbonate addition increased mineralization rates at the low and intermediate altitude, whereas calcium sulphate increased these rates only at the highest altitude. Phosphorus addition had no effect on nitrogen-mineralization at any altitude. (6) Nitrification rates were increased by substrate addition, confirming that the reaction was substrate limited. However, the stimulation was much less than the amount of added substrate, and other limiting factors are clearly important. Calcium sulphate also increased nitrification, but only at the lowest altitude. (7) These findings agree with the general hypothesis that nitrogen-mineralization and nitrification rates are reduced in montane tropical rain forest, and may be a contributory factor controlling growth, species composition and stand structure. The significance of these results for future management of montane tropical rain forest is briefly discussed.},

We will also conduct rapid transect studies of poorly monitored regions. Field expeditions analysed local soil and plant properties in the first phase (2001–2002). Initial results suggest that the network has the potential to reveal much information on the continental-scale relations between forest and environment.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Distributions of mobile animals have been shown to be heavily influenced by habitat and climate. We address the historical and contemporary context of fish habitats within a major zootone: the Recherche Archipelago, southern western Australia. Baited remote underwater video systems were set in nine habitat types within three regions to determine the species diversity and relative abundance of bony fishes, sharks and rays. Constrained ordinations and multivariate prediction and regression trees were used to examine the effects of gradients in longitude, depth, distance from islands and coast, and epibenthic habitat on fish assemblage composition. A total of 90 species from 43 families were recorded from a wide range of functional groups. Ordination accounted for 19{\%} of the variation in the assemblage composition when constrained by spatial and epibenthic covariates, and identified redundancy in the use of distance from the nearest emergent island as a predictor. A spatial hierarchy of fourteen fish assemblages was identified using multivariate prediction and regression trees, with the primary split between assemblages on macroalgal reefs, and those on bare or sandy habitats supporting seagrass beds. The characterisation of indicator species for assemblages within the hierarchy revealed important faunal break in fish assemblages at 122.30 East at Cape Le Grand and subtle niche partitioning amongst species within the labrids and monacanthids. For example, some species of monacanthids were habitat specialists and predominantly found on seagrass ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Acanthaluteres vittiger, Scobinichthys granulatus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), reef ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Meuschenia galii, Meuschenia hippocrepis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) or sand habitats ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Nelusetta ayraudi{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}). Predatory fish that consume molluscs, crustaceans and cephalopods were dominant with evidence of habitat generalisation in reef species to cope with local disturbances by wave action. Niche separation within major genera, and a sub-regional faunal break, indicate future zootone mapping should recognise both cross-shelf and longshore environmental gradients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Terrestrial carbon stock mapping is important for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees ≥ 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood specific gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally fitted models. Wood specific gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter–height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter–height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of the stem tissue were examined for the arborescent rain forest palms Welfia georgii, Iriartea gigantea, Socratea durissima, Euterpe macrospadix, Prestoea decurrens, and Cryosophila albida. Dry density, elastic modulus, and modulus of rupture are greatest toward the base and periphery of palm stems. All of these properties increase markedly with inferred age. The capacity to increase stem stiffness and strength is the major means by which arborescent palms compensate for increased structural demands during height growth. Young palms are overbuilt with respect to diameter and older palms are underbuilt, compared with arborescent dicotyledons and conifers. Yet there is a tendency to maintain a constant margin of safety against mechanical failure by increases in stem tissue stiffness and strength, with initial low values increasing to exceptionally high values. Stiffness and strength of palm stem tissue increase more rapidly with specific gravity than would be expected from existing models that describe mechanical properties of cellular solids. This difference between palm stem tissue and common woods may result from differences in cell structure and cell wall chemical composition.

abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations can fertilize plant growth. The resulting increased plant uptake of CO2 could, in turn, slow increases in atmospheric CO2 levels and associated climate warming. CO2 fertilization effects may be enhanced when water availability is low, because elevated CO2 also leads to improved plant water-use efficiency. However, CO2 fertilization effects may be weaker when plant growth is limited by nutrient availability. How variation in soil nutrients and water may act together to influence CO2 fertilization is unresolved. Here we report plant biomass levels from a five-year, open-air experiment in a perennial grassland under two contrasting levels of atmospheric CO2, soil nitrogen and summer rainfall, respectively. We find that the presence of a CO2 fertilization effect depends on the amount of available nitrogen and water. Specifically, elevated CO2 levels led to an increase in plant biomass of more than 33{\%} when summer rainfall, nitrogen supply, or both were at the higher levels (ambient for rainfall and elevated for soil nitrogen). But elevated CO2 concentrations did not increase plant biomass when both rainfall and nitrogen were at their lower level. We conclude that given widespread, simultaneous limitation by water and nutrients, large stimulation of biomass by rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations may not be ubiquitous.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Because of ancient human impacts on soils and wildlife, as well as current intensive land-use practices, Tropandean landscapes are being depleted not only of nutrients and organic matter in cultivated soils, but also water catchment and other resources, including fisheries, forestry, mining, agriculture, and livestock that mountain peoples are producing as a result of the governmental policies of subsidized capital inputs. The exodus of young people to the cities in the Andean world exacerbates the deterioration of the rural quality of life and brings issues of marginality, poverty, and neglect into the cultural landscape. In view of this critical situation, novel conservation approaches are suggested, reflecting needed changes to contemporary paradigms of mountain studies; with the use of case examples from Andean countries, mainly Ecuador, are questioned axioms of tropical ecology. These are less clear in the field than in the scanty literature on tropical mountains, offering a holistic view of the Tropandean landscape. Hence, verticality, marginality, centrality, power and violence, expansion, religion and myth, ethnic pride and inspiration, are seen as conventional paradigms of montology that have to be re-examined in light of modern environmental thought in the Andes},

Fisheries and hydropower-induced mortality pre- sumably play an important role during the downstream migration of silver eels, and downstream-migrating silver eels must make various navigation and route-selection decisions to reach the sea. We examined the influence of river discharge on route selection of silver eels. To quantify the impact of hydropower and fisheries on silver eel mortality, radio-telemetry experiments were performed in the River Meuse in 2002 and 2004, surgically implanting 300 silver eels with Nedap-transponders. Route selection and passage beha- viour near detection stations was assessed. Silver eels were distributed over the alternative migration routes in the river in proportion to the discharge until the silver eels reached the entrance to the turbines. The eels altered their behaviour when approaching the turbines of hydropower plants and showed stationary and recurrent behaviour. We discuss the consequences of this on route selection and mortality rates caused by hydropower facilities and fisheries. Keywords:},

abstract = {We assessed movement patterns in relation to habitat availability (reflected by the extent of tidal flooding) for several commercially and recreationally important species in and out of a small mangrove creek within the subtropical Burrum River estuary (25°10′S 152°37′E) in Queensland, Australia. Movement patterns of Acanthopagrus australis, Pomadasys kaakan, Lutjanus russelli and Mugil cephalus were examined between December 2006 and April 2007 using a stationary passive integrated transponder (PIT) system adapted for saline environments (30-38 ppt) and underwater digital video cameras (DVCs). This is the second known application of a stationary PIT tag system to studying fish movement in estuarine environments. The transponder system was set in place for 104 days and recorded {\textgreater}5000 detections. Overall 'recapture' rate of tagged fish by the transponder system was {\textgreater}40{\%}. We used PIT tags implanted in a total of 75 fish from a tidal creek connected to the main channel of the estuary. We also developed a high-resolution digital elevation (2.5 m cell size) model of the estuary derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and aerial imagery to estimate inundation dynamics within the tidal creek, and related the timing of inundation in various habitats to the timing of fish immigration to and emigration from the creek. Over 50{\%} of all tagged fish were moving in and out of the creek at a threshold level when 50{\%} of the mangrove forest became flooded. Individuals of all four species moved into and out of the tidal creek repeatedly at different times depending on species and size, indicating strong residential behaviour within the estuary. The main activity of fishes was at night time. Manual interpretation of video from {\textgreater}700 fish sightings at three different mangrove sites confirmed the findings of the stationary PIT system, that the function of shelter vs food in mangrove habitat may be size dependent. Our established techniques assess the spatial ecology of estuarine fish and provide important insights into fish habitat utilisation and site fidelity behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial freshwater and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in "established use." Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

abstract = {The near surface humidity in a megadiverse mountain ecosystem in southern Ecuador is examined on the basis of Relative Humidity (RH) measurements inside the natural mountain forest and at open sites along an altitudinal gradient from 1700 to 3200m. The main methodological aim of the current study is to generate a humidity regionalization tool to provide spatial datasets on average monthly mean, minimum and maximum RH, Specific Humidity (q) and Specific Saturation Deficit (DS) by using observation data of RH. The maps based on data of the period 1999-2009 are needed by ecological projects working on various plots where no climate station data are available. The humidity maps are generated by combining a straightforward detrending technique with a Digital Elevation Model and a satellite-based land cover classification which also provides the relative forest cover per pixel. The topical aim of the study is to investigate the humidity distribution and structure of both manifestations of our ecosystem (pastures and natural vegetation) with special considerations to the ecosystem regulation service by converting natural forest into pasture. The results reveal a clear differentiation over the year, partly triggered by the change of synoptic weather situation but also by land cover effects. Humidity amplitudes are particularly low during the main rainy season when cloudiness and rainfall are high, but markedly pronounced in the relative dry season when daily irradiance and outgoing nocturnal radiation causes distinct differences between the land cover units. Particularly the upper pasture areas gained by slash and burn of the natural forest exhibit the lowest humidity values while the humidity inside the mountain forest is significantly higher due to the regulating effects of the dense vegetation. Thus, clearing the forest clearly reduces the regulation function (regulating ecosystem services) of the ecosystem which might become problematic for reforestation under future global warming. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Any climate action project that seeks to obtain recognition, and potentially carbon benefits, for the GHG emissions reductions it achieves must accurately calculate those reductions over time using scientifically rigorousmethods that will stand up to external review. Carbon inventory and monitoring plans are designed to quantify the changes in key carbon (C) pools in and around the project area and to project local land-use changes by monitoring patterns of land-use in proxy regions, trend modeling, and analyzing socio-economic and other data. Data from the inventory and monitoring activities are used to calculate the difference between the with- and withoutproject scenarios.The Guaraque{\c{c}}aba Climate Action Project is being implemented bySPVS (Sociedade de Pesquisa em Vida Selvagem e Educa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o Ambiental), in partnership with TNC (The Nature Conservancy) and AEP (American Electric Power). It has an area of approximately 7,000 hectares and is located in Paran{\'{a}} State, Brazil, within the Environmental Protection Area ofGuaraque{\c{c}}aba in the Atlantic Rain Forest. This ecosystem is recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Organization (UNESCO) as one of the planet's highest priorities for conservation and has designated it World Biosphere Reserve.The main goals of the project are biodiversity conservation, restoration ofdegraded pasture, sustainable development of local communities, andgeneration of carbon offsets that are real, measurable, and verifiable.The requirements for a good monitoring program should include thefollowing: (i) use the most appropriate and cost-effective methodology for the region; (ii) follow quality assurance/control plan (QA/QC) and standardoperating procedures (SOPs); (iii) train local NGOs and field personnel on SOPs; (iv) elaboration of a vegetation map and stratification of the project area; (v) post-monitoring independent verification; (vi) record-keeping and data entry, analysis, interpretation, maintenance, and archiving. The Winrock international methodology (MacDicken, 1997), adapted to the local conditions, was selected to measure and monitor carbon at the project. A QA/QC and SOP documents were developed for the project to guarantee that carbon measurements done during the lifetime of the project are consistent and accurate. Researchers and technicians from SPVS were trained on the SOP before the beginning of the carbon inventory and monitoring field work. A total of 12 strata were identified, but only 6 forest strata were under threat of deforestation and therefore used to estimate carbon stocks and offsets. A total of 188 permanent plots were established with 68 in the submontane forest (1162,5 ha), 11 in the lowland forest (427 ha), 10 in the floodplain forest (173 ha), 63 in advanced/medium forest (1,783 ha), 24 in medium secondary forest (545 ha), and 12 in young secondary forest (279 ha). Twenty-eight clip plots were established on the pasture (409 ha) and shrublands (279 ha). The preliminary average carbon stock (aboveground woody biomass) estimated for the 6 forest strata were the following: submontane forest: 135.9 t C ha-1; lowland forest: 106.8 t C ha-1; floodplain forest: 64.12 t C ha-1; advanced/medium forest: 106.1 t C ha-1; medium secondary forest: 101.96 t C ha-1; young secondary forest: 42.89 t C ha-1. The above ground carbon for the pasture strata was 2.4 t C ha-1 and for the shrublands 7.4 C ha-1. The general wet biomass equation that is currently being used to estimate the carbon stock is being verified and adjusted from the destructive sampling effort that is being conducted by SPVS. A new biomass equation for tree fern was also developed, which showed a strong correlation between biomass and height.The results of this effort will help to improve and develop models tomeasure and monitor carbon stock in very complex and heterogeneouslandscapes, such as the ones found in the Atlantic Forest Biome, and topromote projects that are designed to generate multiple benefits such asbiodiversity, soil and water conservation, restoration of degraded lands, andsustainable development of local communities.},

The dynamical evolution of the estuarine variables and corresponding observations are modelled with a nonlinear state-space model. Two DA methods are used for controlling the evolution of the model state by integrating information from observations. These are the reduced rank square root (RRSQRT) Kalman filter, which is a suboptimal implementation of the extended Kalman filter, and the ensemble Kalman filter which allows for nonlinear evolution of error statistics while still applying a linear equation in the analysis. First, these methods are applied and examined with a simple 1D ecological model. Then the RRSQRT Kalman filter is applied to the 3D hydrodynamics of the Odra lagoon using the model TRIM3D and water elevation measurements from fixed pile stations. Geostatistical modelling ideas are discussed in the application of these algorithms.},

abstract = {We compiled new and published data on the natural abundance N isotope composition (delta(15)N values) of soil and plant organic matter from around the world. Across a broad range of climate and ecosystem types, we found that soil and plant delta(15)N values systematically decreased with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) and decreasing mean annual temperature (MAT). Because most undisturbed soils are near N steady state, the observations suggest that an increasing fraction of ecosystem N losses are N-15-depleted forms (NO3, N2O, etc.) with decreasing MAP and increasing MAT. Wetter and colder ecosystems appear to be more efficient in conserving and recycling mineral N. Globally, plant delta(15)N values are more negative than soils, but the difference (delta(15)N(plant)-delta(15)N(soil)) increases with decreasing MAT (and secondarily increasing MAP), suggesting a systematic change in the source of plant-available N (organic/NH4+ versus NO3-) with climate. Nitrogen isotopes reflect time integrated measures of the controls on N storage that are critical for predictions of how these ecosystems will respond to human-mediated disturbances of the global N cycle.},

abstract = {Because all microclimatic variables change with elevation, it is difficult to compare plant performance and especially photosynthetic capacity at different elevations. Indeed, most previous studies investigated photosynthetic capacity of low- and high-elevation plants using constant temperature, humidity and light but varying CO2 partial pressures (P CO2). Using gas exchange measurements, we compared here maximum assimilation rates (A max) at ambient and constant-low-elevation P CO2 for two temperate tree species along an altitudinal gradient (100 to 1600 m) in the Pyrenees mountains. Significant differences in A max were observed between the CO2 partial pressure treatments for elevations above 600 m, the between-treatment differences increasing with elevation up to 4 mol m-2 s-1. We found an increase in A max with increasing elevation at constant-low-elevation P CO2 but not at ambient P CO2 for both species. Given a 10{\%} change in P CO2, a proportionally higher shift in maximum assimilation rate was found for both species. Our results showed that high elevation populations had higher photosynthetic capacity and therefore demonstrated that trees coped with extreme environmental conditions by a combination of adaptation (genetic evolution) and of acclimation. Our study also highlighted the importance of using constant CO2 partial pressure to assess plant adaptation at different elevations.},

abstract = {Resolving the shoreline undulation due to tidal excursion is a crucial part of modelling water flow in estuaries and coastal areas. Nevertheless, maintaining positive water column depth and numerical stability has proved out to be a very difficult task that requires special attention. In this paper we propose a novel wetting-drying method in which the position of the sea bed is allowed to fluctuate in drying areas. The method is implemented in a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Model (DG-FEM). Unlike most methods in the literature our method is compatible with fully implicit time-marching schemes, thus reducing the overall computational cost significantly. Moreover, global and local mass conservation is guaranteed which is crucial for long-term environmental applications. In addition consistency with tracer equation is also ensured. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with a set of test cases as well as a real-world application to the Scheldt Estuary. Due to the implicit time integration, the computational cost in the Scheldt application is reduced by two orders of magnitude. Although a DG-FEM implementation is presented here, the wetting-drying method is applicable to a wide variety of shallow water models. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research was to measure forest soil C stocks and estimate turnover times along a 1.3 km rise in elevation in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Turnover times were calculated based on estimated soil C inputs and near steady state soil C stocks in the O-horizon and the mineral soil to a 30-cm soil depth. Monte Carlo methods were used in the calculations to accommodate uncertainties in model parameterization. Measured mean stocks and calculated median turnover times of soil C ranged from 4.4 to 12.2 kg C m- 2 and 11 to 31 years, respectively. The predicted turnover times reflect a high proportion of labile soil C over the selected sampling depth. Both forest soil C stocks and the predicted turnover time of soil C increased with altitude. There were no consistent trends for stand basal area and forest soil C inputs along the elevation gradient suggesting that altitudinal changes in soil C stocks and turnover times could be attributed to different rates of soil organic matter decomposition. Soil respiration flux did not vary significantly with altitude, but soil respiration normalized for existing soil C stocks indicated decreasing rates of soil organic matter decomposition with increasing elevation. Measured soil N stocks and differences in O-horizon litter chemistry indicated increasing N availability from low-elevation to high-elevation forests. Soil C storage and turnover time increased from warmer, drier, less N-rich forests to colder, wetter, more N-rich forests. Considered together, these data support assumptions of a declining rate of soil organic matter decomposition with increasing elevation in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Representative characterization of long-term litter C inputs is one of the most challenging aspects of the present analysis. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Scientific soil analysis is not an effective approach for SQ assessment in developing regions. An alternative option to evaluate using farmer knowledge is thus necessary but this can be sound after verified scientifically in the context of each region. The present study aims to evaluate SQ status (categories) identified by local farmers using scientific soil measurements, and assess their potential as indicators of soil degradation for decision making in the Mai-Negus catchment, northern Ethiopia. In this study, the scientifically measured soil attributes significantly differed (P ??? 0.05) among the SQ categories identified by the local farmers. Using variables retained in the four identified component factors, discriminant analysis identified soil porosity to be the most powerful variable that can help discriminate the SQ status. The study shows that farmer derived SQ status (low, medium, high) could be crucial in providing basis for management and policy decision making as validated by analytical components. Therefore, attention should be given toward integrating farmer knowledge in SQ management to increase chance of technology adoption by farmers. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the influence of environmental factors on the fish distribution and abundance in Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon. Seasonal fish sampling stations were distributed along the lagoon and grouped in three zones from a mixo-oligohaline waters zone with high contribution of freshwater to a mixo-eurihaline waters zone with high marine water influence. A mixo-mesohaline waters zone characterized the middle part of the lagoon. The results showed that the fish composition was dominated by marine estuarine dependent (ED) species in all three zones and in all seasons: Odontesthes argentinensis, Brevoortia aurea, Mugil liza and Micropogonias furnieri were the most representative species. The following important ecological category was freshwater fishes (FW), with Platanichthys platana and Jenynsia multidentata being the most representative species. According to the best model selected, by fitting generalized linear models, abundance of ED increased as water temperature increased during summer and autumn in all three zones. The highest abundance was recorded in the mixo-eurihaline waters zone. On the other hand, FW abundance increased with high rainfall and also when easterly winds blew. In conclusion, a differential habitat use by the species that occur in the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon was observed. A few ED species dominated the fish composition but FW species also made use of the lagoon during periods of heavy rainfall.},

abstract = {Although clouds are the most recognisable and defining feature of tropical montane cloud forests, little research has focussed on how clouds affect plant functioning. We used satellite and ground-based observations to study cloud and leaf wetting patterns in contrasting tropical montane and pre-montane cloud forests. We then studied the consequences of leaf wetting for the direct uptake of water accumulated on leaf surfaces into the leaves themselves. During the dry season, the montane forest experienced higher precipitation, cloud cover and leaf wetting events of longer duration than the pre-montane forest. Leaf wetting events resulted in foliar water uptake in all species studied. The capacity for foliar water uptake differed significantly between the montane and pre-montane forest plant communities, as well as among species within a forest. Our results indicate that foliar water uptake is common in these forest plants and improves plant water status during the dry season.},

abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management.},

abstract = {Metacommunity structure can be shaped by a variety of processes operating at different spatial scales. With increasing scale, the compositional variation among local communities (beta diversity) may reflect stronger environmental heterogeneity, but may also reflect reduced exchange of organisms between habitat patches. We analyzed the spatial architecture of a metacommunity of cladoceran zooplankton in temporary pools of High Andes wetlands, with the objective of explaining the spatial dependency of its structure. The spatial distribution of the pools is hierarchical and highly discontinuous: pools are clustered within small wetlands, which lay scattered over valleys that are separated from each other by mountain ridges. We studied a total of 59 pools, belonging to six different wetlands in four different valleys. We assessed pool environmental heterogeneity and sampled active communities and dormant propagule banks of cladoceran zooplankton. Environmental heterogeneity proved very high within wetlands and showed almost no increase with increasing spatial scale. Conversely, diversity partitioning analyses indicated an increase in beta diversity with spatial scale, especially among valleys. Variation partitioning on environmental data and spatial RDA models suggested environmental heterogeneity as the most important generator of beta diversity within wetlands. At the largest spatial scale, beta diversity manifested itself mainly as a differentiation of species occurrence patterns among valleys, which could not be entirely explained by environmental variables. Our study thus presents a case where environmental control seems to be the dominant metacommunity structuring process at the smallest spatial scale, whereas neutral processes and dispersal limitation are the most likely generators of beta diversity at the largest spatial scale.},

abstract = {Due to climate change, drier summers have been observed over the last ten years in Mediterranean areas. Increasing drought levels may have a different weight in influencing the stomatal versus photosynthetic activity of forests, altering the water-use efficiency (i.e., WUE, the amount of carbon gain per water lost) and, consequently, the global carbon balance. By combining leaf gas exchanges and leaf carbon/oxygen isotope measurements, we tested under Mediterranean conditions a semi-quantitative dual isotope model to track adjustments in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and maximum CO2 assimilation at saturating light (A(max)) in response to changes in air and soil water availability. The experiment was established at Allumiere site (Rome, Italy) over the course of two consecutive years. There, we modified the amount of precipitation reaching the soil on water depleted (D) and watered (W) replicate plots (similar to 100 m(2)) of an Arbutus unedo L. forest using a system of rain gutters and sprinklers, respectively. Changes in soil water availability affected g(s) and A(max) in parallel. As an application of the model, we found that, in response to reduced air and soil water availability, constant carbon (delta C-13) and increasing oxygen (delta O-18) isotope values were consistent with a parallel decline of either g(s) and A(max). As a result of parallel decline, WUE did not differ or only slightly differed between treatments, in contrast with most of the studies that found a wide-spread increase of WUE in response to enhanced drought. This study highlights the potentiality of the dual isotope model to provide insights of forest ecosystem functioning in Mediterranean environments.},

For trees of known biomass (from destructive harvests) which H-model form and geographic scale (plot, region, and continent) most reduces biomass estimate uncertainty?$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n2. How much does including H relationship estimates derived in (1) reduce uncertainty in biomass estimates across 327 plots spanning four continents?$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n3. What effect does the inclusion of H in biomass estimates have on plot- and continental-scale forest biomass estimates?$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe mean relative error in biomass estimates of the destructively harvested trees was half (mean 0.06) when including H, compared to excluding H (mean 0.13). The power- and Weibull-H asymptotic model provided the greatest reduction in uncertainty, with the regional Weibull-H model preferred because it reduces uncertainty in smaller-diameter classes that contain the bulk of biomass per hectare in most forests. Propagating the relationships from destructively harvested tree biomass to each of the 327 plots from across the tropics shows errors are reduced from 41.8 Mg ha−1 (range 6.6 to 112.4) to 8.0 Mg ha−1 (−2.5 to 23.0) when including {\$}H{\$}. For all plots, above-ground live biomass was 52.2±17.3 Mg ha−1 lower when including H estimates (13{\%}), with the greatest reductions in estimated biomass in Brazilian Shield forests and relatively no change in the Guyana Shield, central Africa and southeast Asia. We show fundamentally different stand structure across the four forested tropical continents, which affects biomass reductions due to {\$}H{\$}. African forests store a greater portion of total biomass in large-diameter trees and trees are on average larger in diameter. This contrasts to forests on all other continents where smaller-diameter trees contain the greatest fractions of total biomass. After accounting for variation in {\$}H{\$}, total biomass per hectare is greatest in Australia, the Guyana Shield, and Asia and lowest in W. Africa, W. Amazonia, and the Brazilian Shield (descending order). Thus, if closed canopy tropical forests span 1668 million km2 and store 285 Pg C, then the overestimate is 35 Pg C if H is ignored, and the sampled plots are an unbiased statistical representation of all tropical forest in terms of biomass and height factors. Our results show that tree {\$}H{\$} is an important allometric factor that needs to be included in future forest biomass estimates to reduce error in estimates of pantropical carbon stocks and emissions due to deforestation},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems worldwide are under threat with many fish species and populations suffering from human over-exploitation. This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate the potential of using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from ½-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species. Records in national databases confirmed the occurrence of all detected species. To investigate the efficiency of the eDNA approach, we compared its performance with 9 methods conventionally used in marine fish surveys. Promisingly, eDNA covered the fish diversity better than or equal to any of the applied conventional methods. Our study demonstrates that even small samples of seawater contain eDNA from a wide range of local fish species. Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100-bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-of-concept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources.},

abstract = {Multivariate geostatistics have been used to obtain a detailed and high-quality map of the median grain-size distribution of the sand fraction at the Belgian Continental Shelf. Sandbanks and swales are the dominant geomorphological features and impose a high-spatial seafloor variability. Interpolation over complex seafloors is difficult and as such various models were investigated. In this paper, linear regression and ordinary kriging (OK) were used and compared with kriging with an external drift (KED) that makes use of secondary information to assist in the interpolation. KED proved to be the best technique since a linear correlation was found between the median grain-size and the bathymetry. The resulting map is more realistic and separates clearly the sediment distribution over the sandbanks from the swales. Both techniques were also compared with a simple linear regression of the median grain-size against the bathymetry. An independent validation showed that the linear regression yielded the largest average prediction error (almost twice as large as with KED). Unlike most static sedimentological maps, our approach allows for defining grain-size classes that can be adapted according to the needs of various applications. These relate mainly to the mapping of soft substrata habitats and of the most suitable aggregates for extraction. This information is highly valuable in a marine spatial planning context. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Clay specialist species grew significantly faster than white-sand specialists in both soil types when protected from herbivores. However, when unprotected, white-sand specialists dominated in white-sand forests and clay specialists dominated in clay forests.

abstract = {Motivated by the need to solve ecological problems (climate change, habitat fragmentation and biological invasions), there has been increasing interest in species distribution models (SDMs). Predictions from these models inform conservation policy, invasive species management and disease-control measures. However, predictions are subject to uncertainty, the degree and source of which is often unrecognized. Here, we review the SDM literature in the context of uncertainty, focusing on three main classes of SDM: niche-based models, demographic models and process-based models. We identify sources of uncertainty for each class and discuss how uncertainty can be minimized or included in the modelling process to give realistic measures of confidence around predictions. Because this has typically not been performed, we conclude that uncertainty in SDMs has often been underestimated and a false precision assigned to predictions of geographical distribution. We identify areas where development of new statistical tools will improve predictions from distribution models, notably the development of hierarchical models that link different types of distribution model and their attendant uncertainties across spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the need to develop more defensible methods for assessing predictive performance, quantifying model goodness-of-fit and for assessing the significance of model covariates.},

abstract = {Species' rarity is expressed and measured at a variety of spatial scales, and rarity at different scales could be correlated. Considerable empirical evidence has supported a positive correlation between spatial distribution and local numerical abundance of species, which could create a syndrome of rarity for species limited in geographic distribution and occurring at low densities even in their primary habitats. We used auditory-count data and range information for birds in the Tilar??n mountains of Costa Rica to examine the abundance-distribution relationship in cloud forest species and to determine if endemic species (limited to Costa Rican-Panamanian highlands or Central America) are locally rare or restricted in ecological distribution. We found a positive correlation between abundance and distribution at the smallest spatial scale: species occupying few sites in the study area had low abundances where they occur. At larger scales, geographical distribution measured categorically was correlated with local ecological amplitude (zones occupied). Local abundance, however, was not correlated across all species with estimates of range size (km2), although most endemics exhibited below-median abundance. Within families with endemics and cosmopolitan species, 72{\%} of narrow endemics were among the rarest species. For most narrow endemics, we rejected the possibility that they are sufficiently specialized within their habitats to reach relatively high densities. A conclusive test of the abundance-distribution relationship at large spatial scales and evaluation of global population size for endemics will require a comprehensive analysis using abundance data from throughout species' ranges. Such analyses for tropical species will be a long time coming, but it is meanwhile prudent to recognize that many endemics are threatened at several spatial scales, including the risks of small local populations. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The lakes face recurrent desiccation and eruption events and showed distinct differences in their water chemistry. Thirty cores from the upper 15 cm of sediment indicate distinct differences in the composition of meiobenthic communities between the lakes. In total, 27 different aquatic metazoan species could be distinguished. Numerically, rotifers dominated in two of the lakes, with mean densities up to 4.56 × 106 individuals m−2 while the third lake was dominated by a gastrotrich of the genus Chaetonotus (0.67 × 106 individuals m−2). The largest lake harboured up to 14.4 × 106 nematodes m−2, which is the highest nematode density thus far reported for a freshwater habitat. The lakes yielded few nematode species (S = 7, N = 887) and calculation of the Shannon–Wiener index (H′) indicated an exceptionally low nematode diversity. The nematode community of one lake was clearly dominated by an undescribed suction-feeding Mesodorylaimus (59.6{\%}), the community of the other lake by the epistrate feeder Achromadora pseudomicoletzkyi (89.3{\%}), whereas the third lake surprisingly contained no nematodes. The benthic nematode biomasses for the two nematode-containing lakes differed by a factor 50. The food webs of the three lakes are presumed to have an exceptionable simply structure.},

The existing view is that one must choose between correlative models for many species versus process-based models for few species. We suggest that opportunities exist to produce process-based range models for many species, by using hierarchical and inverse modeling to borrow strength across species, fill data gaps, fuse diverse data sets, and model across biological and spatial scales. We review the statistical ecology and population and range modeling literature, illustrating these modeling strategies in action. A variety of large, coordinated ecological datasets that can feed into these modeling solutions already exist, and we highlight organisms that seem ripe for the challenge.},

abstract = {Correlations between foliar nutrient concentrations and soil nutrient availability have been found in multiple ecosystems. These relationships have led to the use of foliar nutrients as an index of nutrient status and to the prediction of broadscale patterns in ecosystem processes. More recently, a growing interest in ecological stoichiometry has fueled multiple analyses of foliar nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios within and across ecosystems. These studies have observed that N:P values are generally elevated in tropical forests when compared to higher latitude ecosystems, adding weight to a common belief that tropical forests are generally N rich and P poor. However, while these broad generalizations may have merit, their simplicity masks the enormous environmental heterogeneity that exists within the tropics; such variation includes large ranges in soil fertility and climate, as well as the highest plant species diversity of any biome. Here we present original data on foliar N and P concentrations from 150 mature canopy tree species in Costa Rica and Brazil, and combine those data with a comprehensive new literature synthesis to explore the major sources of variation in foliar N:P values within the tropics. We found no relationship between N:P ratios and either latitude or mean annual precipitation within the tropics alone. There is, however, evidence of seasonal controls; in our Costa Rica sites, foliar N:P values differed by 25{\%} between wet and dry seasons. The N:P ratios do vary with soil P availability and/or soil order, but there is substantial overlap across coarse divisions in soil type, and perhaps the most striking feature of the data set is variation at the species level. Taken as a whole, our results imply that the dominant influence on foliar N:P ratios in the tropics is species variability and that, unlike marine systems and perhaps many other terrestrial biomes, the N:P stoichiometry of tropical forests is not well constrained. Thus any use of N:P ratios in the tropics to infer larger-scale ecosystem processes must comprehensively account for the diversity of any given site and recognize the broad range in nutrient requirements, even at the local scale.},

abstract = {This paper presents the sediment module designed for the two-dimensional depth-averaged and one-dimensional section-averaged components of the finite-element model SLIM (Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model) in the framework of its application to the tidal part of the Scheldt Basin. This sediment transport module focuses on fine-grained, cohesive sediments. It is a necessary tool to undertake environmental biogeochemical studies, in which fine sediment dynamics play a crucial role. The variables are the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and the concentration of the sediments freshly deposited on the bottom. Sediment dynamics is controlled by the transport of SSC by advection and diffusion, while deposition and resuspension processes also depend on other physical, chemical and biological conditions. Besides building a functioning fine sediment transport model, the aim of this study is to identify, parametrize and quantify the key processes that are necessary to represent satisfactorily the suspended sediment dynamics in the Scheldt Estuary and tidal river network. It is known that the settling velocity of suspended sediments is influenced by flocculation. The important factors governing this process include the SSC itself, the turbulence, the shear stress, the salinity, the biological activity and some physicochemical properties (e.g. pH). In this sediment module, only SSC, salinity and biological activity are explicitly taken into account. In addition, the influence of the biological activity on the bottom layer erodibility is considered, as well as the mud proportion on the bottom, because the presence of sand increases the ability of the bottom layer to erode. Finally, the influence of a convergence zone between bottom currents carrying large amounts of fine sediments is also included in the model.The computer cost of a two-dimensional model is significantly smaller than that of the three-dimensional models traditionally deemed indispensable in sediment transport modeling. Even if the present simplified model is designed for the specific situation of the Scheldt, it produces results that are rather similar to those obtained with more complex, three-dimensional tools, but at a significantly lower cost. Therefore, it is believed that the model presented herein is suitable and useful for long-term environmental simulations in the Scheldt Estuary. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper draws from previously published studies on high-resolution, hyperspectral remote sensing of coastal and inland waters and provides an overview of how the HyspIRI mission could enable the retrieval of new aquatic biophysical products or improve the retrieval accuracy of existing satellite-derived products (e.g., inherent optical properties, phytoplankton functional types, pigment composition, chlorophyll-a concentration, etc.). The intent of this paper is to introduce the development of the HyspIRI mission to the coastal and inland remote sensing community and to provide information regarding several potential data products that were not originally part of the HyspIRI mission objectives but could be applicable to research related to coastal and inland waters. Further work toward quantitatively determining the extent and quality of these products, given the instrument and mission characteristics, is recommended.},

A mixed-species tree equation based on breast height diameter (DBH) and tree height (H) provided acceptable estimates of stem plus branch ({\textgreater}10 cm in diameter over bark) volume, which was multiplied by live tree density to estimate dry matter. For dead standing spars, DBH, estimated original height, actual spar height and compatible volume/taper functions provided estimates of dead stem volume, which was multiplied by live tree density and a density modifier based on log decay class from field assessments to estimate dry matter. Live tree density was estimated using ratio estimators. Ratio estimators were based on biomass sample trees, and utilized density data from outerwood basic density surveys which were available for 35 tree species sampled throughout New Zealand. Foliage and branch ({\textless}10 cm in diameter over bark) dry matter were estimated directly from tree DBH. Tree fern above ground dry matter was estimated using allometric equations based on DBH and H. Due to insufficient data, below ground carbon for trees was estimated using the default IPCC root/shoot ratio of 25{\%}, but for tree ferns it was estimated using measured root/shoot ratios which averaged 20{\%}.},

abstract = {The biomass of tropical forests plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, both as a dynamic reservoir of carbon, and as a source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in areas undergoing deforestation. However, the absolute magnitude and environmental determinants of tropical forest biomass are still poorly understood. Here, we present a new synthesis and interpolation of the basal area and aboveground live biomass of old-growth lowland tropical forests across South America, based on data from 227 forest plots, many previously unpublished. Forest biomass was analyzed in terms of two uncorrelated factors: basal area and mean wood density. Basal area is strongly affected by local landscape factors, but is relatively invariant at regional scale in moist tropical forests, and declines significantly at the dry periphery of the forest zone. Mean wood density is inversely correlated with forest dynamics, being lower in the dynamic forests of western Amazonia and high in the slow-growing forests of eastern Amazonia. The combination of these two factors results in biomass being highest in the moderately seasonal, slow growing forests of central Amazonia and the Guyanas (up to 350 Mg dry weight ha−1) and declining to 200-250 Mg dry weight ha−1 at the western, southern and eastern margins. Overall, we estimate the total aboveground live biomass of intact Amazonian rainforests (area 5.76 × 106 km2 in 2000) to be 93±23 Pg C, taking into account lianas and small trees. Including dead biomass and belowground biomass would increase this value by approximately 10{\%} and 21{\%}, respectively, but the spatial variation of these additional terms still needs to be quantified},

Plots aggrading biomass were characterized by either minor biomass losses due to mortality or substantial increases in the biomass of large trees (DBH {\textgreater}= 60 cm). Conclusions Within the study period, the rarity of mortality events could not counter-balance the slow permanent increase in biomass, resulting in an apparent increase in biomass.

abstract = {Increasing anthropogenic pressures urge enhanced knowledge and understanding of the current state of marine biodiversity. This baseline information is pivotal to explore present trends, detect future modifications and propose adequate management actions for marine ecosystems. Coralligenous outcrops are a highly diverse and structurally complex deep-water habitat faced with major threats in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite its ecological, aesthetic and economic value, coralligenous biodiversity patterns are still poorly understood. There is currently no single sampling method that has been demonstrated to be sufficiently representative to ensure adequate community assessment and monitoring in this habitat. Therefore, we propose a rapid non-destructive protocol for biodiversity assessment and monitoring of coralligenous outcrops providing good estimates of its structure and species composition, based on photographic sampling and the determination of presence/absence of macrobenthic species. We used an extensive photographic survey, covering several spatial scales (100s of m to 100s of km) within the NW Mediterranean and including 2 different coralligenous assemblages: Paramuricea clavata (PCA) and Corallium rubrum assemblage (CRA). This approach allowed us to determine the minimal sampling area for each assemblage (5000 cm(2) for PCA and 2500 cm(2) for CRA). In addition, we conclude that 3 replicates provide an optimal sampling effort in order to maximize the species number and to assess the main biodiversity patterns of studied assemblages in variability studies requiring replicates. We contend that the proposed sampling approach provides a valuable tool for management and conservation planning, monitoring and research programs focused on coralligenous outcrops, potentially also applicable in other benthic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Shallow landslides are an important type of natural ecosystem disturbance in tropical montane forests. Due to landslides, vegetation and often also the upper soil layer are removed, and space for primary succession under altered environmental conditions is created. Little is known about how these altered conditions affect important aspects of forest recovery such as the establishment of new tree biomass and species composition. To address these questions we utilize a process-based forest simulation model and develop potential forest regrowth scenarios. We investigate how changes in different trees species characteristics influence forest recovery on landslide sites. The applied regrowth scenarios are: undisturbed regrowth (all tree species characteristics remain like in the undisturbed forest), reduced tree growth (induced by nutrient limitation), reduced tree establishment (due to thicket-forming vegetation and dispersal limitation) and increased tree mortality (due to post-landslide erosion and increased susceptibility). We then apply these scenarios to an evergreen tropical montane forest in southern Ecuador where landslides constitute a major source of natural disturbance. Our most important findings are. (a)On the local scale of a single landslide tree biomass recovers within the first 80 years after landslides for most scenarios, but it takes at least 200 years for the post-landslide forest to reach a structure (in terms of stem size distribution) similar to a mature forest. On this scale forest productivity is reduced for most regrowth scenarios. Changes in different tree species characteristics produce distinct spatio-temporal patterns of tree biomass distribution in the first decades of recovery within the landslide disturbed area. These patterns can potentially be used for identifying the dominant processes that drive forest recovery on landslide disturbed sites.(b)On the larger scale of the landscape overall tree biomass is reduced by 9-15{\%} due to landslide disturbances. Overall forest productivity is only slightly reduced ({\textless}6{\%}), but landslides increase landscape heterogeneity and produce hotspots of biomass loss and 'blind spots' of forest productivity. Thus landslides have a strong impact on the distribution of biomass in tropical montane forests. This study demonstrates that dynamic forest models are useful tools for complementing field based studies on landslides; they allow for testing alternative hypotheses on different sources of heterogeneity across spatial scales and investigating the influence of landslides on long-term forest dynamics. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The biotic integrity of the Guayas River basin in Ecuador is at environmental risk due to extensive anthropogenic activities. We investigated the potential impacts of hydromorphological and chemical variables on biotic integrity using macroinvertebrate-based bioassessments. The bioassessment methods utilized included the Biological Monitoring Working Party adapted for Colombia (BMWP-Col) and the average score per taxon (ASPT), via an extensive sampling campaign that was completed throughout the river basin at 120 sampling sites. The BMWP-Col classification ranged from very bad to good, and from probable severe pollution to clean water based on the ASPT scores. Generalized linear models (GLMs) and sensitivity analysis were used to relate the bioassessment index to hydromorphological and chemical variables. It was found that elevation, nitrate-N, sediment angularity, logs, presence of macrophytes, flow velocity, turbidity, bank shape, land use and chlorophyll were the key environmental variables affecting the BMWP-Col. From the analyses, it was observed that the rivers at the upstream higher elevations of the river basin were in better condition compared to lowland systems and that a higher flow velocity was linked to a better BMWP-Col score. The nitrate concentrations were very low in the entire river basin and did not relate to a negative impact on the macroinvertebrate communities. Although the results of the models provided insights into the ecosystem, cross fold model development and validation also showed that there was a level of uncertainty in the outcomes. However, the results of the models and sensitivity analysis can support water management actions to determine and focus on alterable variables, such as the land use at different elevations, monitoring of nitrate and chlorophyll concentrations, macrophyte presence, sediment transport and bank stability.},

abstract = {We tested the capabilities and limitations of a novel autonomous acoustic positioning telemetry system with data from fifteen field deployments off the Florida coast. Telemetry array coverage areas ranged between 100 and 300. m across. For fixed transmitters within the array, the fraction of transmissions leading to high-quality calculated position estimates averaged 44{\%}, with wide variation. Positional accuracy was about 2. m. The choice of filtering strictness represented a trade-off between the accuracy and frequency of positions. There was substantial temporal variation, but no clear pattern (e.g., daily or tidal correlations) in frequency of positions. There was no spatial bias within the array. Array performance for stationary transmitters was robust to user errors in sound speed and hydrophone position estimates. Performance was less robust for a transmitter attached to an autonomous underwater vehicle moving through the array, with 22{\%} of transmissions leading to position estimates. Overall the system produced reliable results, but as the use of acoustic telemetry in complex ecological studies increases it is important to recognize technological requirements and limitations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Monitoring fish and underwater habitats, particularly in and around marine protected areas (MPAs) requires non-destructive observation methods. This is generally achieved by divers conducting underwater visual censuses (UVC), but video-based techniques are now being used more often to observe underwater macrofauna and habitats. A comparison of these two techniques is relevant with the development of high-definition (HD) video, which constitutes a substantial improvement over previously available video resolutions at limited extra cost. We conducted a paired observation experiment involving both HD video and UVC in an MPA located in the New Caledonian lagoon, which is a highly diversified coral reef ecosystem. We compared three techniques for counting fish along 50. m. × 4. m delineated strip transects: UVC and two video techniques in which the diver used either a straight trajectory (I-type transect) or a browsing one (S-type transect). The results showed that the proportion of fish that were not identified up to the species level did not exceed 3.3{\%} in video observations versus 1.7{\%} in UVC. The abundance and species richness were larger in UVC than in videos, and S-type transects detected more individuals and species than I-type transects. The average abundance and species richness observed by UVC were 1094 individuals and 69.7 species per transect respectively. In comparison with UVC, I-type and S-type video transects detected on average 56{\%} and 61{\%} of the abundance and 85{\%} and 77{\%} of the species richness seen by UVC respectively. Our results showed that, in comparison to UVC data recorded in situ, the post field analysis of HD video images provided representative observations of fish abundance and species diversity, although fewer species and individuals were detected. The advantages and shortcomings of each observation technique for monitoring fish assemblages, particularly in an MPA are discussed. HD video appears to be a cost-effective technique in terms of the human resources and time needed for field implementation. Overall, this study suggests that HD video-based techniques constitute an interesting complement to UVC, or an alternative when these cannot be implemented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The soil of 30 plots along six transects was characterized. The appearance of the 'dry to the touch' character at a depth of less than 1.2 m was used to discriminate soils exhibiting vertical drainage from soils exhibiting superficial lateral drainage and along with colour and texture, to define five classes from well-drained to strongly hydromorphic soils. Spatial variation in soil respiration was closely related to topographic position and soil type. Increasing soil water content and bulk density and decreasing root biomass and soil carbon content explained most of the decrease in soil respiration from the plateaux (vertically drained hypoferralic acrisol) to the bottomlands (haplic gleysol). These results will help to stratify further field experiments and to identify the underlying determinants of spatial variation in soil respiration to develop mechanistic models of soil respiration.},

abstract = {Studies were conducted during 1991-1993 on environmental factors affecting the upstream migration of eels in the Rivers Severn and Avon, England. Migrants ({\textgreater}156 000 pigmented elvers and {\textgreater}189 000 juveniles) were trapped as they attempted to ascend weir or sluice barriers. Multiple regression models were developed to compare catches per trap per night (C) with data for various key environmental parameters at seven sites, from the tidal limit to a maximum of 42.5 km upstream. The key stimulus for migration of both elvers and juveniles at the tidal limit was water temperature, with some weaker monthly influences related to seasonal temperature increases. Smaller annual influences probably related to earlier glass eel recruitment into the lower estuary. A weak early tidal effect was demonstrated only once, in 1993 in the Severn. Temperature also exerted significant effects on C of juvenile eels at the tidal limit and in the non-tidal rivers, although effects weakened with distance upstream. Year, month, river flows and whether traps were mounted on weirs or sluices made only small contributions at a few sites. Distance between traps also contributed to combined data for upper Severn sites. The threshold temperature in all cases was 14-16 degrees C, with low to zero catches below 10-11 degrees C, catch maxima being achieved above 18-20 degrees C. The implications of strong temperature-dependence of migration in relation to stock recruitment and management are discussed. Special reference is made to recent decreases in recruitment of eels to Europe and N. America and possible long-term effects of global warming. (C) 1997 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {The Clean Water Act requires that state and local agencies assess all river miles for potential impairments. However, due to the large number of river miles to be assessed, as well as budget and resource limitations, many states cannot feasibly meet this requirement. Therefore, there is a need for a framework that can accurately assess water quality at un-monitored locations, using limited data resources. Many researchers employ geostatistical techniques such as kriging and Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) to interpolate values in areas where no data exist. These techniques rely on the spatial and/or temporal autocorrelation between existing data points to estimate at un-monitored locations. This autocorrelation is traditionally a function of the Euclidean distance between those data points; however, a Euclidean distance does not take into account that many water quality variables may be spatially correlated due to the hydrogeography of the system. The focus of this work is the development of a space/time geostatistical framework for estimating and mapping water quality along river networks by using river distances instead of the traditional Euclidean distance. The Bayesian Maximum Entropy method of modern space/time geostatistics is modified and extended to incorporate the use of river distances to improve the estimation of basinwide water quality. This new framework, termed river-BME, uses geostatistical iv models that integrate the use of permissible covariance functions with secondary information along with river distance. Factors, such as network complexity, are explored to determine the efficacy of using river-BME for water quality estimation. Additionally, simulation experiments and three real world case studies provide a broad application of this framework for a variety of basins and water quality parameters, including dissolved oxygen, Escherichia coli, and fish tissue mercury. Results show that the use of river-BME produces significantly more accurate estimates of water quality at un-monitored locations than traditional Euclidean based methods by more than 30{\%}. Overall, this work provides a new tool for applying modern space/time geostatistics using river distances. It has the potential to aid not only future researchers but can ultimately provide environmental managers with the information necessary to better allocate resources and protect ecological and human health.},

abstract = {Reliable estimates of the biomass of Amazonian forests are needed for calculations of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation. Interpretation of forest volume data for the region is the most practical means of obtaining representative biomass estimates, The density of the wood used in converting volume data to biomass is a key factor affecting estimates of biomass and of emissions. Interpreting density data for biomass purposes, which is different from the normal use of these data for commercial timber uses, is complicated by a variety of factors. There is variability among individuals of a given species, among geographic locations, and within the vertical and radial dimensions of individual trees. Considerable confusion has resulted from the variety of ways that densities are reported with respect to humidity at time of the weight and volume measurements used in calculating the density value. The most appropriate measure for biomass is basic density, or oven-dry weight divided by wet volume. Corrections for hollow trees and the position of samples within trunks are also needed. Here, available data are brought together for 268 species of trees, with an unweighted mean basic density of 0.65 (range 0.14-1.21). Weighting the mean by the volume of wood of each species in a sample of vegetation types, and weighting the means of the vegetation types by the extent of each in the region, yields a mean density of 0.69. Although the weighted mean density calculated here has a much firmer empirical basis than previously available estimates for this parameter, uncertainty is still considerable, particularly as a result of doubt concerning taxonomic identifications in the forestry surveys. Were the wood density of a small but botanically well-studied plot near Manaus to apply to the region as a whole, Brazil's 1990 emissions of greenhouse gases would be higher by an amount equivalent to two-thirds of the country's annual emission from fossil fuels.},

abstract = {Nutrient supply commonly limits aboveground plant productivity in forests, but the effects of an altered nutrient supply on gross primary production (GPP) and patterns of carbon (C) allocation remain poorly characterized. Increased nutrient supply may lead to a higher aboveground net primary production (ANPP), but a lower total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA), with little change in either aboveground plant respiration (APR) or GPP. Alternatively, increases in nutrient supply may increase GPP, with the quantity of GPP allocated aboveground increasing more steeply than the quantity of GPP allocated belowground. To examine the effects of an elevated nutrient supply on the C allocation patterns in forests, we determined whole-ecosystem C budgets in unfertilized plots of Eucalyptus saligna and in adjacent plots receiving regular additions of 65 kg N ha(-1), 31 kg P ha(-1), 46 kg K ha(-1), and macro- and micronutrients. We measured the absolute flux of C allocated to the components of GPP (ANPP, TBCA and APR), as well as the fraction of GPP allocated to these components. Fertilization dramatically increased GPP. Averaged over 3 years, GPP in the fertilized plots was 34{\%} higher than that in the unfertilized controls (3.95 vs. 2.95 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Fertilization-related increases in GPP were allocated entirely aboveground - ANPP was 85{\%} higher and APR was 57{\%} higher in the fertilized than in the control plots, while TBCA did not differ significantly between treatments. Carbon use efficiency (NPP/GPP) was slightly higher in the fertilized (0.53) compared with the control plots (0.51). Overall, fertilization increased ANPP and APR, and these increases were related to a greater GPP and an increase in the fraction of GPP allocated aboveground.},

abstract = {Fisheries bycatch is a recognized threat to marine megafauna. Addressing bycatch of pelagic species however is challenging owing to the dynamic nature of marine environments and vagility of these organisms. In order to assess the potential for species to overlap with fisheries, we propose applying dynamic habitat models to determine relative probabilities of species occurrence for specific oceanographic conditions. We demonstrate this approach by modelling habitats for Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis) and black-footed albatrosses (Phoebastria nigripes) using telemetry data and relating their occurrence probabilities to observations of Hawaii-based longline fisheries in 1997-2000. We found that modelled habitat preference probabilities of black-footed albatrosses were high within some areas of the fishing range of the Hawaiian fleet and such preferences were important in explaining bycatch occurrence. Conversely, modelled habitats of Laysan albatrosses overlapped little with Hawaii-based longline fisheries and did little to explain the bycatch of this species. Estimated patterns of albatross habitat overlap with the Hawaiian fleet corresponded to bycatch observations: black-footed albatrosses were more frequently caught in this fishery despite being 10 times less abundant than Laysan albatrosses. This case study demonstrates that dynamic habitat models based on telemetry data may help to project interactions with pelagic animals relative to environmental features and that such an approach can serve as a tool to guide conservation and management decisions.},

abstract = {The implicit hydrologic dimensions of international efforts to mitigate climate change, specifically potential impacts of the Clean Development Mechanism-Afforestation/Reforestation (CDM-AR) provisions of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) on global, regional and local water cycles, are examined. The global impact of the redistribution of water use driven by agriculture and land use change, of which CDM-AR can be a contributing factor, is a major component of ongoing global change and climate change processes. If converted to forest, large areas deemed suitable for CDM-AR would exhibit increases in actual evapotranspiration (AET) and/or decreases in runoff. Almost 20{\%} (144 Mha) of all suitable land showed little or no impact on runoff and another 28{\%} (210 Mha) showed only moderate impact. About 27{\%} (200 Mha) was in the highest impact class, exhibiting an 80-100{\%} decrease in runoff, and prevalent in drier areas (based on Aridity Index (AI)), the semi-arid tropics, and in conversion from grasslands and subsistence agriculture. Significant impacts on local hydrologic cycles were evident, however large impacts were not predicted at regional or global scale due primarily to the current limit on carbon offset projects under the Kyoto Protocol. Predicted decreases in runoff ranged from 54{\%} in drier areas to less than 15{\%} in more humid areas, based on four case studies located across a range of biophysical conditions and project scenarios in Ecuador and Bolivia. Factors other than climate, e.g. upstream/downstream position, were shown to be important in evaluating off-site impacts. This study demonstrates that it will become increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional water resources, and how the hydrologic dimension of CDM-AR impacts on issues of sustainability, local communities, and food security. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The vertical and horizontal distribution of juvenile salmonid migrants on approach to the dams influences bypass success in rivers. Accordingly, fish distributions have been studied for nearly three decades. These studies, however, have not been integrated and summarized in a single body of work to determine overall patterns in the spatial distribution of emigrants. We reviewed peer-reviewed and gray literature to summarize species-specific trends in the horizontal and vertical distributions of emigrating salmonids as measured by several different methods. We found that there were no species-specific differences in horizontal distributions and that fish were often oriented with the river thalweg. There were weak differences between species in vertical distributions, e.g., juvenile yearling steelhead were shallower during the day than yearling Chinook salmon. For sockeye, coho, and subyearling Chinook salmon, the data were limited or conflicting. Studies were purposefully designed to measure distributions at certain dams under particular environmental conditions for specific, local purposes. The non-standard sampling design has hampered the development of testable hypothesis on fish distributions in the Snake and Columbia rivers. Recent advances in individual-based models are offering the potential to forecast fish distributions near dams and facilitate improved bypass system design.},

abstract = {Background: Data on below-ground production of tropical montane forests along elevation gradients are scarce. Aims: To determine fine, coarse and large root biomass and productivity along a 2000 m elevation transect. Methods: In five south Ecuadorian mountain forests along a transect from 1000 to 3000 m above sea level, fine ({\textless} 2 mm diameter), coarse (2–50 mm) and large root biomass ({\textgreater} 50 mm) were analysed by soil coring and excavation of soil pits. Fine root production was estimated synchronously by three different approaches (sequential soil coring, the ingrowth core method, and the mini-rhizotron technique). Coarse and large root production was estimated by recording diameter increment using dendrometer tapes. Results: Fine root biomass increased four-fold between 1000 and 3000 m; coarse and large root biomass doubled. The three approaches for estimating fine root production yielded highly divergent results, with the mini-rhizotron approach giving the most reliable data, and indicating a significant increase in fine root production with elevation. Conclusions: Our results indicate a marked carbon allocation shift from above- to below-ground towards higher elevations, which is probably a consequence of increasing nutrient limitation of tree growth with increasing elevation.},

abstract = {The dependence of aboveground biomass and productivity of tropical forests on soil fertility is not fully understood, since previous studies yielded contrasting results. Here, we quantify aboveground biomass (AGB) and stem wood production, and examine the impact of soil chemistry on these parameters in mature tropical forest stands of the equatorial Andes in Ecuador. In 80 plots of 0.04 ha at four elevation levels (500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 m a.s.l., total sample area = 3.2 ha), we measured ten important soil chemical parameters, inventoried all trees ≥10 cm dbh and monitored stem diameter growth with dendrometer tapes in 32 plots. Top canopy height and stem density significantly decreased from 500 to 2,000 m, while tree basal area increased and AGB remained invariant (344 ± 17 Mg DM ha(-1), mean ± SE) with elevation. Wood specific gravity (WSG) showed a significant, but small, decrease. Stem wood production decreased from 4.5 to 3.2 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1) along the transect, indicating a higher biomass turnover at lower elevations. The only soil variable that covaried with AGB was exchangeable K in the topsoil. WSG increased with decreases in N mineralisation rate, soil pH and extractable Ca and P concentrations. Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that nitrogen availability acts on stem wood production only indirectly through a negative relation between N mineralisation rate and WSG, and a positive effect of a lowered WSG on stem growth. The SEM analysis showed neither direct nor indirect effects of resin-extractable P on wood production, but a negative P influence on AGB. We conclude that nitrogen availability significantly influences productivity in these Andean forests, but both N and P are affecting wood production mainly indirectly through alterations in WSG and stem density; the growth-promoting effect of N is apparently larger than that of P.},

abstract = {This study presents a first attempt to quantify the biogeochemical transformations and fluxes of carbon and nutrients along the entire mixing zone of the shallow, tidally-dominated estuary-coastal zone continuum of the Scheldt (Belgium/The Netherlands). A fully transient, two-dimensional, nested-grid hydrodynamic model of the continuum is coupled to the biogeochemical MIRO model for the coastal zone and the CONTRASTE model for the estuary. Transient model simulations are performed with a high spatial (80-750 m) and temporal (30 min) resolution over a period of one year (January-December 1995). The high temporal resolution allows including the short-term variability triggered by the tides, the freshwater discharge and the wind stress. System scale simulations provide time series of nutrient transformations and fluxes along the entire estuary-coastal zone continuum, as well as highly resolved nutrient inventories for the estuarine and the coastal zone sub-domains. Simulation results reveal that the balance between highly variable estuarine nutrient inputs and physical constrains set by the unsteady residual transport field exert an important control on the magnitude and succession of phytoplankton blooms and the ecosystem structure in the coastal zone. In addition, they suggest that the poorly surveyed estuarine-coastal zone interface plays a central role in the continuum. In this dynamic area, marked spatial concentration gradients develop and episodically lead to a reversal of material fluxes from the coast into the estuary. During distinct episodes of the productive period, euryhaline coastal diatoms intrude far upstream into the saline estuary. This intrusion reduces the estuarine nutrient concentrations and export fluxes, thereby reinforcing the nutrient limitation in the coastal area. As a consequence, the estuarine filter does not operate independently from the processes in the coastal zone. The dynamic interplay between the two ecosystems and the intense process rates operating at their transition, therefore, strongly supports our continuum approach. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {By studying animal movements, researchers can gain insight into many of the ecological characteristics and processes important for understanding population-level dynamics. We developed a Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) for estimating the expected movement path of an animal, using discrete location data obtained at relatively short time intervals. The BBMM is based on the properties of a conditional random walk between successive pairs of locations, dependent on the time between locations, the distance between locations, and the Brownian motion variance that is related to the animal's mobility. We describe two critical developments that enable widespread use of the BBMM, including a derivation of the model when location data are measured with error and a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the Brownian motion variance. After the BBMM is fitted to location data, an estimate of the animal's probability of occurrence can be generated for an area during the time of observation. To illustrate potential applications, we provide three examples: estimating animal home ranges, estimating animal migration routes, and evaluating the influence of fine-scale resource selection on animal movement patterns.},

abstract = {In tropical montane forests nutrients released from the organic layers of the soil can supply a large part of the vegetation's requirements. We have examined concentrations, storage, and turnover times of nutrients in the organic layer and the ̄uxes of nutrients by the fall of small litter (leaves, seeds, ̄owers, small twigs, and plant debris that passed an opening of 0.3 m Q 0.3 m) in such a forest in Ecuador. The times taken for litter to turn over were estimated by relating nutrient storage in the organic layer to rate of litterfall and by incubating samples in the laboratory. The organic layer had a thickness of 2±43 cm, a mass of 30±713 t ha±1, and a nutrient storage of 0.87±21 t N, 0.03±0.70 t P, 0.12±2.5 t K, 0.09±3.2 t Ca, and 0.07±1.0t Mg ha±1. The pH (in H2O) ranged between 3.1 and 7.4 and was correlated with the concentrations of Ca and Mg (r = 0.83 and 0.84, respectively). The quantity of small litter (8.5±9.7 t year±1) and mean concentrations of nutrients in litter (19±22 g N, 0.9±1.6 g P, 6.1±9.1 g K, 12±18 g Ca, and 3.5± 5.8gMgkg±1) were larger than in many other tropical montane forests. The mean turnover times of elements in the organic layer increased in the order, Mg (7.0 years) {\textless} Ca (7.9) {\textless} K (8.5) {\textless} P (11) {\textless} N (14) {\textless} S (15) when calculated as the quotient of storage in the organic layer to ̄ux by litterfall; they were {\textless} 12 years for N, P, and S in the incubation experiment. Under optimum conditions in the laboratory, the mineralization of S was just as large as the S deposition by litterfall. In weakly acid soils Mn and Zn and in strongly acid soils Ca added in a nutrient solution were immobilized during incubation. Thus, lack of S, Mn, Zn, and Ca might limit plant growth on some soils.},

abstract = {This study details two unique methods to quantify cloud-immersion statistics for tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs). The first technique uses a new algorithm for determining cloud-base height using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) cloud products, and the second method uses numerical atmospheric simulation along with geostationary satellite data. Cloud-immersion statistics are determined using MODIS data for March 2003 over the study region consisting of Costa Rica, southern Nicaragua, and northern Panama. Comparison with known locations of cloud forests in northern Costa Rica shows that the MODIS-derived cloud-immersion maps successfully identify known cloud-forest locations in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) database. Large connected regions of cloud immersion are observed in regions in which the trade wind flow is directly impinging upon the mountain slopes; in areas in which the flow is parallel to the slopes, a fractured spatial distribution of TMCFs is observed. Comparisons of the MODIS-derived cloud-immersion map with the model output show that the MODIS product successfully captures the important cloudimmersion patterns in the Monteverde region of Costa Rica. The areal extent of cloud immersion is at a maximum during morning hours and at a minimum during the afternoon, before increasing again in the evening. Cloud-immersion frequencies generally increase with increasing elevation and tend to be higher on the Caribbean Sea side of the mountains. This study shows that the MODIS data may be used successfully to map the biogeography of cloud forests and to quantify cloud immersion over cloud-forest locations.},

abstract = {Belpaire, C., and Goemans, G. 2007. Eels: contaminant cocktails pinpointing environmental contamination. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: –. There is growing concern that insufficient somatic and health conditions of silver European eels (Anguilla anguilla) emigrating from European waters to oceanic spawning areas might be a key causative factor in the decline of the stock. One factor that could contribute to deterioration in the status of eels is high contaminant accumulation in their body. Contaminants may affect lipid metabolism and result in lower energy stores. A high body burden of contaminants and low energy stores might be responsible for failure of migration and/or impairment of successful reproduction. During a 12-year study on a relatively small area within the river basins of IJzer, Scheldt, and Meuse (ca. 13 500 km2), 2613 eels were sampled covering a dense monitoring network of 357 stations. Eels were analysed for ca. 100 chemicals. These included PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, heavy metals, brominated flame retardants, volatile organic pollutants (VOCs), endocrine disruptors, dioxins, perfluorooctane sulphonic acids (PFOSs), metallothioneins, and polycyclic aromatic compounds. This series represents only a very small fraction ({\textless}0.5{\%}) of the {\textgreater}30 000 chemicals currently marketed and used in Europe. The biomonitoring value of eels as a tool for monitoring environmental contamination is illustrated. Two major conclusions were drawn: (i) the eel is a highly suitable biomonitor for environmental contaminants, for both local and international purposes, e.g. to evaluate the chemical status for the Water Framework Directive, and (ii) dependent on the degree of pollution in their habitat, the levels of certain contaminants reported in yellow eels can be high, and might affect their potential for reproduction.},

abstract = {In order to better understand the associative behavior of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus) with anchored fish aggregating devices (FADs), we conducted long-term monitoring of these tuna tagged with ultrasonic transmitters, using automated receivers deployed on seven FADs around the Okinawa Islands. Current and surface water temperature were also monitored by data loggers attached to the stations as a way to examine the influence of these factors on the associative behavior of tuna with FADs. We monitored a total of 52 yellowfin and 11 bigeye tuna at monitoring FADs for a period of 2.5 years. We found that the majority of tuna remained continuously at the monitoring stations for a certain period (max.=55 days) without day-scale ({\textgreater}24 h) absences, until they left the stations completely. The residence time at a single FAD was estimated to be about 7 days, as the half-life for both yellowfin and bigeye tuna. No inter-specific differences were seen, though there was a significant difference in residence time between two size classes: the residence time of the larger size class was shorter than that of the smaller size class. We also found there was a periodicity of approximately 24 h and regularity of associative behavior, estimated based on the fluctuation pattern of the detection rate and of short-term ({\textless}24 ah) absences. In particular, absences of several hours occurring once a day with high temporal precision were considered to be excursions within several nautical miles from the FADs. These results indicate that tuna express periodic behavior in relation to the FADs and can locate the FADs precisely enough to return to them after a certain time. No relationship was seen between associative behavior and abiotic oceanographic conditions. Therefore, the biological environment (prey availability, the presence of predators, etc.) and the internal state of the individual (hunger, etc.) may be more important than abiotic environmental cues for inducing changes in associative behavior and/or the departure from FADs. In addition, the strong association of tuna with a single FAD and the relatively prolonged residence time observed in the present study may relate to the vigorous activity of FAD fisheries in Okinawa and their utilization of a large amount of bait.},

abstract = {This paper presents the sediment module designed for the two-dimensional depth-averaged and one-dimensional section-averaged components of the finite-element model SLIM (Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model) in the framework of its application to the tidal part of the Scheldt Basin. This sediment transport module focuses on fine-grained, cohesive sediments. It is a necessary tool to undertake environmental biogeochemical studies, in which fine sediment dynamics play a crucial role. The variables are the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and the concentration of the sediments freshly deposited on the bottom. Sediment dynamics is controlled by the transport of SSC by advection and diffusion, while deposition and resuspension processes also depend on other physical, chemical and biological conditions. Besides building a functioning fine sediment transport model, the aim of this study is to identify, parametrize and quantify the key processes that are necessary to represent satisfactorily the suspended sediment dynamics in the Scheldt Estuary and tidal river network. It is known that the settling velocity of suspended sediments is influenced by flocculation. The important factors governing this process include the SSC itself, the turbulence, the shear stress, the salinity, the biological activity and some physicochemical properties (e.g. pH). In this sediment module, only SSC, salinity and biological activity are explicitly taken into account. In addition, the influence of the biological activity on the bottom layer erodibility is considered, as well as the mud proportion on the bottom, because the presence of sand increases the ability of the bottom layer to erode. Finally, the influence of a convergence zone between bottom currents carrying large amounts of fine sediments is also included in the model. The computer cost of a two-dimensional model is significantly smaller than that of the three-dimensional models traditionally deemed indispensable in sediment transport modeling. Even if the present simplified model is designed for the specific situation of the Scheldt, it produces results that are rather similar to those obtained with more complex, three-dimensional tools, but at a significantly lower cost. Therefore, it is believed that the model presented herein is suitable and useful for long-term environmental simulations in the Scheldt Estuary.},

abstract = {The remarkable migrations of some fishes are still the subject of active research, but there has been much less attention on the evolutionary or behavioral origins of diadromous migrations. Diadromy likely evolved as a result of the adaptive advantage of using higher productivity habitats for growth, but the reason why the first individuals left their habitat to enter a new one is unknown. The objective of this paper is to examine the possible evolutionary and behavioral origin of diadromous fish migration and to explore the possible factors that could have led to the development of migratory behavior, using a behavioral model for a triggering mechanism of fish migration. Eels likely evolved in the tropics from a marine ancestor, and salmon evolved in temperate regions from a freshwater ancestor. Evidence of the ancestral life history states of these fishes can be seen in geographic clines of occurrence of nonmigratory residents of the sympatric Japanese eel Anguilla japonica, a catadromous species, and masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou, an anadromous species, with a higher proportion of resident type "sea eels" at higher latitudes, whereas masu salmon have more river residents at lower latitudes. The amphidromous ayu Plecoglossus altivelis was used as a model species for exploring the behavioral origins of migration. The triggering mechanism of upstream migration of ayu Could be explained by a three-step model of necessary conditions for starting migration that include age and body size, endocrinological condition, and psychological processes. A behavioral model of drive was proposed to explain the last step that is influenced by exogenous/endogenous factors such as water temperature, fish density, and hunger level. The drive Of upstream migration behavior appears to be a psychological repulsion that occurs in stressed fish when the behavioral rule of optimum interindividual distance is broken, since fish with stronger repulsion and a larger interindividual distance showed more active jumping behavior and stronger upstream migration. A vacuum activity of jumping behavior of ayu contained in a limited space occurred in random directions without any behavioral stimuli when water temperature increased. This vacuum activity can be interpreted as an escapement behavior of fish that bolt out of unfavorable environments, and this escapement might be a behavioral origin of fish migration that may also help to understand the evolutionary origin of migration (random escapement hypothesis).},

abstract = {1. Biogeographical models of species' distributions are essential tools for assessing impacts of changing environmental conditions on natural communities and ecosystems. Practitioners need more reliable predictions to integrate into conservation planning (e.g. reserve design and management). 2. Most models still largely ignore or inappropriately take into account important features of species' distributions, such as spatial autocorrelation, dispersal and migration, biotic and environmental interactions. Whether distributions of natural communities or ecosystems are better modelled by assembling individual species' predictions in a bottom-up approach or modelled as collective entities is another important issue. An international workshop was organized to address these issues. 3. We discuss more specifically six issues in a methodological framework for generalized regression: (i) links with ecological theory; (ii) optimal use of existing data and artificially generated data; (iii) incorporating spatial context; (iv) integrating ecological and environmental interactions; (v) assessing prediction errors and uncertainties; and (vi) predicting distributions of communities or collective properties of biodiversity. 4. Synthesis and applications. Better predictions of the effects of impacts on biological communities and ecosystems can emerge only from more robust species' distribution models and better documentation of the uncertainty associated with these models. An improved understanding of causes of species' distributions, especially at their range limits, as well as of ecological assembly rules and ecosystem functioning, is necessary if further progress is to be made. A better collaborative effort between theoretical and functional ecologists, ecological modellers and statisticians is required to reach these goals.},

abstract = {Tropical forests play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, but the amount of carbon they contain and its spatial distribution remain uncertain. Recent studies suggest that once tree height is accounted for in biomass calculations, in addition to diameter and wood density, carbon stock estimates are reduced in many areas. However, it is possible that larger crown sizes might offset the reduction in biomass estimates in some forests where tree heights are lower because even comparatively short trees develop large, well-lit crowns in or above the forest canopy. While current allometric models and theory focus on diameter, wood density, and height, the influence of crown size and structure has not been well studied. To test the extent to which accounting for crown parameters can improve biomass estimates, we harvested and weighed 51 trees (11-169 cm diameter) in southwestern Amazonia where no direct biomass measurements have been made. The trees in our study had nearly half of total aboveground biomass in the branches (44{\%} +/- 2{\%} [mean +/- SE]), demonstrating the importance of accounting for tree crowns. Consistent with our predictions, key pantropical equations that include height, but do not account for crown dimensions, underestimated the sum total biomass of all 51 trees by 11{\%} to 14{\%}, primarily due to substantial underestimates of many of the largest trees. In our models, including crown radius greatly improves performance and reduces error, especially for the largest trees. In addition, over the full data set, crown radius explained more variation in aboveground biomass (10.5{\%}) than height (6.0{\%}). Crown form is also important: Trees with a monopodial architectural type are estimated to have 21-44{\%} less mass than trees with other growth patterns. Our analysis suggests that accounting for crown allometry would substantially improve the accuracy of tropical estimates of tree biomass and its distribution in primary and degraded forests.},

abstract = {Satellite radar altimetry measures the time required for a pulse to travel from the satellite antenna to the earth's surface and back to the satellite receiver. Altimetry on inland lakes generally shows some deviation from in situ level measurements. The deviation is attributed to the geographically varying corrections applied to account for atmospheric effects on radar waves. This study was focused on verification of altimetry data for Lake Kivu (2400 km2), a large inland lake between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and estimating the lake water levels using bathymetric data combined with satellite images. Altimetry data obtained from ENVISAT and ERS-2 satellite missions were compared with water level data from gauging stations for Lake Kivu. Gauge data for Lake Kivu were collected from the stations ELECTROGAZ and Rusizi. ENVISAT and ERS-2 data sets for Lake Kivu are in good agreement with gauge data having R2 of 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. A combination of the two data sets improved the coefficient of determination to 95{\%} due to the improved temporal resolution of the data sets. The calculated standard deviation for Lake Kivu water levels was 0.642 m and 0.701 m, for ENVISAT and ERS-2 measurements, respectively. The elevation-surface area characteristics derived from bathymetric data in combination with satellite images were used to estimate the lake level gauge. Consequently, the water level of Lake Kivu could be estimated with an RMSE of 0.294 m and an accuracy of ±0.58 m. In situations where gauges become malfunctioning or inaccessible due to damage or extreme meteorological events, the method can be used to ensure data continuity.

abstract = {A nutrient-to-fish-model with an explicit two-way interaction between a biogeochemical model of the lower food web and a fish model component is presented for the example of the Baltic Sea, demonstrating the feasibility of a consistent coupling of the upper and lower parts of the food web in a Eulerian model system. In the Baltic Sea, the fish stock is dominated by two prey species (sprat and herring) and one predator (cod). The dynamics of the fish model is driven by size (mass-class) dependent predator-prey interactions while the interaction between the biogeochemical and Fish model component is established through feeding of prey fish on zooplankton and recycling of fish biomass to nutrients and detritus. The fish model component is coupled to an advanced three dimensional biogeochemical model (ERGOM, Neumann et al., 2002). A horizontally explicit representation of fish requires the implementation of fish behavior. As a first step, we propose an algorithm to stimulate fish migration by letting the fish follow the food. Moreover, fish species are guided to their respective spawning areas. Results of first three-dimensional simulations are presented with emphasis on the transport of matter by moving fish. The spawning areas of cod and sprat are in the deep basins, which are not well reached by advective transport. Hence the deposition of matter in these areas by spawning fish could play some role in the distribution of matter. The approach is not limited to applications for the Baltic and the model can be transferred also to other systems. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology. Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, from acquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels to more conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.},

Acoustic telemetry is one of the primary tools for the assessment of animal movements in aquatic systems through either manual tracking or the establishment of fixed receiving sta- tions. Recent technological developments in code division multiple access (CDMA) acous- tic telemetry now enable the simultaneous real-time monitoring of numerous individual fish at fine time scales providing APA researchers with a robust new tool. Fish can be positioned in three-dimensions with sub-meter accuracy in both deep and shallow waters. Here, we describe a whole-lake environmental observatory that includes a 13-hydrophone acoustic telemetry array that has been used to monitor the position of 22 tagged fish at 15 sec intervals. Although we use a freshwater fish and environment as a case study, this telemetry system is equally useful for marine environments including under-ice. We evaluate the ap- plicability of CDMA MAP technology to address pressing questions in applied APA research. The CDMA MAP system provides the flexibility to collect information at multiple spatial- temporal scales, responding to the varied levels of detail and precision required for different applications in APA research. When combined with the suite of other telemetry and monitor- ing approaches available, CDMA MAP technology will enable researchers to document the spatial ecology essential for improving APA science. Furthermore, because numerous ani- mals from different trophic levels can be tracked in real time, CDMA MAP technology will also aid in our understanding of complex community-level dynamics consistent with the shift towards ecosystem-based APA management.},

abstract = {Baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo-BRUV) stations and diver operated stereo-video (stereo-DOV) transects are increasingly used to sample both tropical and temperate fish assemblages. Compared to in situ visual census methods, the use of stereo-video reduces inter-observer variability, improves definition of the sample unit area, increases accuracy of fish length estimates and provides a permanent record of the assemblage that can be validated where required or independently reanalysed. Previous studies have suggested that stereo-BRUV collects representative data on both carnivorous and herbivorous species and can be more cost-efficient than diver-based survey methods. This study compares estimates of common fish assemblage metrics obtained with stereo-BRUV stations and stereo-DOV transects across 3 biogeographic regions, and uses a cost-optimization procedure to compare the efficiency of these 2 methods. Stereo-BRUV stations were found to sample greater species richness and obtain greater estimates of relative biomass of generalist carnivores, but no differences occurred in the biomass of herbivores sampled by the 2 techniques. Stereo-BRUV stations generally obtained estimates of assemblage metrics with less variance, resulting in greater power to detect spatial and temporal changes in the fish assemblage metrics. Cost benefit analyses found that stereo-BRUV was generally more time efficient than stereo-DOV transects in terms of smaller standard error around the mean of the various metrics considered.

abstract = {Random walk simulations have an excellent potential in marine and oceanic modelling. This is essentially due to their relative simplicity and their ability to represent advective transport without being plagued by the deficiencies of the Eulerian methods. The physical and mathematical foundations of random walk modelling of turbulent diffusion have become solid over the years. Random walk models rest on the theory of stochastic differential equations. Unfortunately, the latter and the related numerical aspects have not attracted much attention in the oceanic modelling community. The main goal of this paper is to help bridge the gap by developing an efficient adaptive time stepping algorithm for random walk models. Its performance is examined on two idealised test cases of turbulent dispersion; (i) pycnocline crossing and (ii) non-flat isopycnal diffusion, which are inspired by shallow-sea dynamics and large-scale ocean transport processes, respectively. The numerical results of the adaptive time stepping algorithm are compared with the fixed-time increment Milstein scheme, showing that the adaptive time stepping algorithm for Lagrangian random walk models is more efficient than its fixed step-size counterpart without any loss in accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the colonization of restored river reaches by fish depends on the regional species pools; however, quantifications of the relationship between the composition of the regional species pool and restoration outcome are lacking. We analyzed data from 18 German river restoration projects and adjacent river reaches constituting the regional species pools of the restored reaches. We found that the ability of statistical models to describe the fish assemblages established in the restored reaches was greater when these models were based on 'biotic' variables relating to the regional species pool and the ecological traits of species rather than on 'abiotic' variables relating to the hydromorphological habitat structure of the restored habitats and descriptors of the restoration projects. For species presence in restored reaches, 'biotic' variables explained 34{\%} of variability, with the occurrence rate of a species in the regional species pool being the most important variable, while 'abiotic' variables explained only the negligible amount of 2{\%} of variability. For fish density in restored reaches, about twice the amount of variability was explained by 'biotic' (38{\%}) compared to 'abiotic' (21{\%}) variables, with species density in the regional species pool being most important. These results indicate that the colonization of restored river reaches by fish is largely determined by the assemblages in the surrounding species pool. Knowledge of species presence and abundance in the regional species pool can be used to estimate the likelihood of fish species becoming established in restored reaches.},

PAR represented a smaller fraction of total solar radiation (K) in LMCF than in lowland rain forest (LRF). In LMCF trees and shrubs, mean PAR-saturated Pn ranged from 4.3-10.6 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) at 1450m, and from 3.5-10.2 mu mol C m(-2) s-1 at 2150 m. P-n was reduced by abaxial wetness in leaves of some trees and shrubs, and eliminated in others.

abstract = {We examined $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N in needle (current and 1-year-old) and soil samples collected on two occasions (July and September 1999) from a 15-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand in an irrigation and fertilization experiment to investigate whether these treatments leave specific isotope signals in the samples and thus to infer the effects of treatments on C and N cycling. Irrespective of foliar age or sampling date, carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$) was increased by irrigation, and decreased by fertilization. The carbon isotope discrimination model suggested that increased $\Delta$ by irrigation was due to decreased water use efficiency (WUE) through increased stomatal and/or mesophyll conductance. The decreased $\Delta$ by fertilization and published gas exchange measurements at the same site suggest that water stress resulting from increased water demand in the fertilized plots improved WUE through increased stomatal control of water loss. Foliar $\delta$15N values were not affected by irrigation, but were increased by fertilization. The $\delta$15N value of soil NH4+ were higher than those of NO3− and were positively correlated with foliar $\delta$15N, suggesting that tree uptake of NH4+ was one of the factors affecting foliar $\delta$15N. We conclude that irrigation and fertilization affected $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values in plant and soil samples, reflecting changed C and N cycling patterns and water use efficiency in the studied loblolly pine stand.},

However, accessibility for this kind of data with a high level of detail for very shallow and inaccessible marine habitats has been often challenging, time consuming. Spatial and temporal coverage often has to be compromised to make more cost effective the monitoring routine. Nowadays, emerging technologies, can overcome many of these constraints. Here we describe a recent development in remote sensing based on a small unmanned drone (UAVs) that produce very fine scale maps of fish nursery areas. This technology is simple to use, inexpensive, and timely in producing aerial photographs of marine areas. Both technical details regarding aerial photos acquisition (drone and camera settings) and post processing workflow (3D model generation with Structure From Motion algorithm and photo-stitching) are given. Finally by applying modern algorithm of semi-automatic image analysis and classification (Maximum Likelihood, ECHO and Object-based Image Analysis) we compared the results of three thematic maps of nursery area for juvenile sparid fishes, highlighting the potential of this method in mapping and monitoring coastal marine habitats.},

The understanding of the environmental factors controlling litter decomposition is important in the description of the carbon and nutrient cycles of tropical ecosystems, and in predicting their response to long-term increases in temperature. • Samples of litter from 15 species were transplanted across all five sites in the study, and decomposition was tracked over 448 d. • Species' type had a large influence on the decomposition rate (k), most probably through its influence on leaf quality and morphology. When samples were pooled across species and elevations, soil temperature explained 95{\%} of the variation in the decomposition rate, but no direct relationship was observed with either soil moisture or rainfall. The sensitivity of the decay rate to temperature ($\kappa$(T)) varied seven-fold across species, between 0.024 and 0.169 °C⁻¹, with a mean value of 0.118 ± 0.009 °C⁻¹ (SE). This is equivalent to a temperature sensitivity parameter (Q₁₀) for litter decay of 3.06 ± 0.28, higher than that frequently assumed for heterotrophic processes. • Our results suggest that the warming of approx. 0.9 °C experienced in the region in recent decades may have increased decomposition and nutrient mineralization rates by c. 10{\%}.},

abstract = {Linking trends in fish population abundance to environmental characteristics is often difficult because fish use a variety of habitats throughout their ontogeny and may exhibit large interannual fluctuations in abundance. We developed a two-stage boosted regression tree model to investigate spatiotemporal patterns of Southern Flounder Paralichthys lethostigma abundance and distribution in Texas estuaries. We used a 36-year fishery-independent data set (1977–2012) to correlate distribution with environmental conditions and seasonal or long-term changes in abundance. Adult Southern Flounder were sampled with gill nets using a random-stratified design. Predictions of abundance were made to grids of environmental data to identify “hot spots” as well as seasonal or decadal shifts in distribution. Models were fit using cross validation, and variance was estimated using nonparametric bootstrapping. Depth, temperature, distance to a tidal inlet, and salinity were the primary environmental determinants of Southern Flounder distribution and abundance. Because distribution and response to environmental conditions can depend on population abundance, we also developed a standardized index of annual abundance using the same two-stage boosted regression tree model. The index identifies a long-term decline in abundance punctuated by recent recovery (possibly in response to management actions). Mapped results identify a coastwide decline in abundance between 1980–1984 and 2005–2009 but the magnitude varied substantially, suggesting disproportionate changes in abundance across the study area},

abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) in forests temporarily stores C and nutrients and thus contributes to their cycling. To assess the contribution of CWD to element cycles, its element stock and turnover time have to be known. Therefore, we (i) determined the mass and the C and nutrient concentrations of CWD in a montane forest in the south Ecuadorian Andes, (ii) assessed how these properties of CWD related to topographic position and stand properties, and (iii) estimated the turnover rates by using a regression equation of the turnover rate of CWD on temperature from the literature. The study area covers 9 ha and is located at 1900-2180 m above sea level. We selected sixteen 400 m 2-large plots and determined all fallen and standing dead wood with a diameter {\textgreater}0.1 m. The average mass of CWD was 9.1 t ha -1; 40{\%} of the CWD mass did not have soil contact. The individual CWD masses were highly variable among the plots (0.4-23 t ha -1). We did not detect any significant relationship between topographic position or stand properties and mass and C and nutrient stock of CWD. The CWD contributed 4{\%} to the total C stock and {\textless}1.8{\%} to the nutrient stock in aboveground dead biomass (i.e. CWD + organic layer including Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons (taken from a previous publication)). The estimated mean decomposition constant of CWD was 0.09 year -1. The annual nutrient release from CWD contributed at most 1.5{\%} to the totally plant-available nutrients in the forest soil (nutrient input with throughfall and stemflow + release from organic layer (taken from previous publications) + release from CWD). Our results demonstrate that in the studied montane forest the CWD contribution to C stock and nutrient release is small. This might be specific for forests with a thick organic layer. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent observations of widespread changes in mature tropical forests such as increasing tree growth, recruitment and mortality rates and increasing above-ground biomass suggest that 'global change' agents may be causing predictable changes in tropical forests. However, consensus over both the robustness of these changes and the environmental drivers that may be causing them is yet to emerge. This paper focuses on the second part of this debate. We review (i) the evidence that the physical, chemical and biological environment that tropical trees grow in has been altered over recent decades across large areas of the tropics, and (ii) the theoretical, experimental and observational evidence regarding the most likely effects of each of these changes on tropical forests. Ten potential widespread drivers of environmental change were identified: temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, climatic extremes (including El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation events), atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrient deposition, O3/acid depositions, hunting, land-use change and increasing liana numbers. We note that each of these environmental changes is expected to leave a unique 'fingerprint' in tropical forests, as drivers directly force different processes, have different distributions in space and time and may affect some forests more than others (e.g. depending on soil fertility). Thus, in the third part of the paper we present testable a priori predictions of forest responses to assist ecologists in attributing particular changes in forests to particular causes across multiple datasets. Finally, we discuss how these drivers may change in the future and the possible consequences for tropical forests.},

However, they did not receive worldwide recognition among soil scientists until the middle of the 20th century. Development of international classification systems was put forth by the 1978 Andisol proposal of G. D. Smith. The central concept of volcanic ash soils was established after the finding of nonallophanic volcanic ash soils in Japan in 1978. Nowadays, volcanic ash soils are internationally recognized as Andisols in Soil Taxonomy (United States Department of Agriculture) and Andosols in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (FAO, International Soil Reference and Information Centre and International Society of Soil Science).

abstract = {Geostatistics is essential for environmental scientists. Weather and climate vary from place to place, soil varies at every scale at which it is examined, and even man-made attributes - such as the distribution of pollution - vary. The techniques used in geostatistics are ideally suited to the needs of environmental scientists, who use them to make the best of sparse data for prediction, and top plan future surveys when resources are limited. Geostatistical technology has advanced much in the last few years and many of these developments are being incorporated into the practitioner's repertoire. This second edition describes these techniques for environmental scientists. Topics such as stochastic simulation, sampling, data screening, spatial covariances, the variogram and its modeling, and spatial prediction by kriging are described in rich detail. At each stage the underlying theory is fully explained, and the rationale behind the choices given, allowing the reader to appreciate the assumptions and constraints involved.},

abstract = {General patterns of forest dynamics and productivity in the Andes Mountains are poorly characterized. Here we present the first large-scale study of Andean forest dynamics using a set of 63 permanent forest plots assembled over the past two decades. In the North-Central Andes tree turnover (mortality and recruitment) and tree growth declined with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. In addition, basal area increased in Lower Montane Moist Forests but did not change in Higher Montane Humid Forests. However, at higher elevations the lack of net basal area change and excess of mortality over recruitment suggests negative environmental impacts. In North-Western Argentina, forest dynamics appear to be influenced by land use history in addition to environmental variation. Taken together, our results indicate that combinations of abiotic and biotic factors that vary across elevation gradients are important determinants of tree turnover and productivity in the Andes. More extensive and longer-term monitoring and analyses of forest dynamics in permanent plots will be necessary to understand how demographic processes and woody biomass are responding to changing environmental conditions along elevation gradients through this century.},

abstract = {We measured aboveground plant biomass, aboveground net primary pro- ductivity (ANPP), detritus accumulation, and nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by above- ground vegetation in six Metrosideros polymorpha stands on the windward slopes of Mauna Loa, Hawai'i, USA. Our objective was to quantify the effects of elevation (primarily tem- perature) on ecosystem properties during primary succession, as a key to understanding ecosystem-climate interactions. Four study sites were on 111- to 136-yr-old lava flows at elevations of 290, 700, 1130, and 1660 m. Two additional sites on 3400-yr-old lava were at 700 and 1660 m elevations. All sites were on solid pahoehoe (smooth or ropy-textured) lava substrates with gentle relief, were free of significant human disturbance, received abundant precipitation, and had similar vegetation composition. Total aboveground biomass, soil organic matter mass, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) were all greater in the old sites than in young sites. Differences between young and old sites in aboveground live biomass, detrital mass, and ANPP all supported the conclusion that ecosystem devel- opment proceeded relatively faster at 700 m elevation than at 1660 m. However, above- ground biomass in the old sites (81 Mg/ha at 1660 m elevation and 123 Mg/ha at 700 m) was low in comparison with other wet tropical forests. Accumulations of N and P in live biomass and detritus followed the same trends as were observed for organic matter. Rates of soil carbon accumulation over the first 3400 yr of succession averaged 2.1 g.m-2.yr-', similar to other reported soil chronosequences. Observed rates of N accumulation ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 g.m-2. yr-' over the first 136 yr of succession. There were no monotonic elevational trends among young sites with respect to live biomass, detritus mass, or total N or P accumulation. Foliar nitrogen concentrations in the young sites were among the lowest reported from any tropical forests and tended to decline with increasing elevation. The growth and biomass of individual plant species varied in distinctive ways along the elevational gradient. Nevertheless, among young sites there was a direct, linear relationship between total ANPP and mean annual temperature of the site, with a similar pattern in the two old sites. For each 1?C increase in mean annual temperature, total ANPP increased by 54 g.m-2. yr-'. Community-level ANPP also was directly correlated with rates of N and P uptake by the vegetation, regardless of site age or elevation.

The objectives of the study were: (i) to determine the environmental conditions when eels arrived and passed the facility; (ii) to determine the rate of eel escapement (passage other than via the turbines); (iii) to describe the behaviour of eels faced with the intake structure and the permeability of the intake trashracks for the different sizes of eel; and (iv) to determine whether surface bypasses originally designed for salmon could be effective for eels. Five types of behaviour of silver eels in the forebay and at the plant intakes were identified. The study showed the key factor influencing both eel behaviour and the route taken through the plant was variation in river discharge. Escapement rate was related to eel length and the spill flow to river flow ratio, which could be described by a logistic regression model. The surface bypasses originally designed for salmon were found to aid downstream eel migration significantly. At velocities {\textless} 0.40 m.s(-1), no eels, even the largest, for which the racks are a physical barrier, were found impinged on the trashracks.},

abstract = {Tropical rain forests play a dominant role in global biosphere-atmosphere CO(2) exchange. Although climate and nutrient availability regulate net primary production (NPP) and decomposition in all terrestrial ecosystems, the nature and extent of such controls in tropical forests remain poorly resolved. We conducted a meta-analysis of carbon-nutrient-climate relationships in 113 sites across the tropical forest biome. Our analyses showed that mean annual temperature was the strongest predictor of aboveground NPP (ANPP) across all tropical forests, but this relationship was driven by distinct temperature differences between upland and lowland forests. Within lowland forests ({\textless} 1000 m), a regression tree analysis revealed that foliar and soil-based measurements of phosphorus (P) were the only variables that explained a significant proportion of the variation in ANPP, although the relationships were weak. However, foliar P, foliar nitrogen (N), litter decomposition rate (k), soil N and soil respiration were all directly related with total surface (0-10 cm) soil P concentrations. Our analysis provides some evidence that P availability regulates NPP and other ecosystem processes in lowland tropical forests, but more importantly, underscores the need for a series of large-scale nutrient manipulations - especially in lowland forests - to elucidate the most important nutrient interactions and controls.},

abstract = {Antropogenic activities have severely deteriorated the river systems in Flanders as a result of which many functions such as drinking water supply, fishing, ... are being threatened. Because restoration of these river systems entails drastic social and economical consequences, actions should be considered in advance. In this context, migration dynamics of predicted organisms and migration barriers along the river can deliver important additional information for habitat suitability models on the effectiveness of restoration plans. To this purpose, migration models for Baetis (Insecta, Ephemeroptera), Ephemera (Insecta, Ephemeroptera) and Limnephilidae (Insecta, Trichoptera) have been developed for the Zwalm river basin, Flanders, Belgium. The migration models consisted of three resistance layers: one for migration through the air/over land and two for migration through the river in upstream and downstream direction. Based on the Cost Weighted Distance function, source populations and migration potential could be calculated. In combination with habitat suitability calculations based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the migration models were used to simulate the effect of removing a weir used for water quantity control. According to the ANN habitat suitability models, this removal did not affect the habitat suitability for Baetis, Ephemera and Limnephilidae. The ANN models predicted that after restoration the habitat was still not suitable for the taxa considered. In spite of this, the migration model for Baetis could be applied to simulate the possible recolonization of the restored river section in case of further habitat improvement. As calculated by the model, the shortest path with the least accumulative cost for migration would be through the air. Based on the migration model of Baetis, it would take approximately 275 days to recolonize the restored river. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Slow-colonizing forest understorey plants are probably not able to rapidly adjust their distribution range following large- scale climate change. Therefore, the acclimation potential to climate changewithin their actual occupied habitatswill likely be key for their short- and long-term persistence.We combined transplant experiments along a latitudinal gradient with open-top chambers to assess the effects of temperature on phenology, growth and reproductive performance of multiple populations of slow-colonizing understorey plants, using the spring flowering geophytic forb Anemone nemorosa and the earlysummerfloweringgrass Milium effusum as study species. In both species, emergence time and start of flowering clearly advancedwith increasing temperatures. Vegetative growth (plant height, aboveground biomass) and reproductive success (seed mass, seed germination and germinable seed output) of A. nemorosa benefited from higher temperatures. Climatewarming may thus increase future competitive ability and colonization rates of this species. Apart fromthe effects on phenology, growth and reproductive performance of M. effusum generally decreased when transplanted southwards (e.g., plant size and number of individuals decreased towards the south) and was probably more limited by light availability in the south. Specific leaf area of both species increased when transplanted southwards, but decreased with open-top chamber installation in A. nemorosa. In general, individuals of both species transplanted at the home site performed best, suggesting local adaptation. We conclude that contrasting understorey plants may display divergent plasticity in response to changing temperatures which may alter future understorey community dynamics.},

abstract = {1. The climates of two rain forest sites, one montane (altitude 1710 m) and one lowland (altitude 380 m) are described. There is a cooler, wetter season at both, lasting approximately from April to July. 2. The weather at the montane site is analysed; two types of day, `fog-bound' and `fog-free', are distinguished. On typical fog-bound days the forest is shrouded in stratus cloud for much of the time. On typical fog-free days there are prolonged sunny periods. Groups of fog-bound and fog-free days probably alternate throughout the year, the fog-free periods lasting up to 1 or 2 weeks in the dry season. No such division into extreme weather types is possible for the lowland forest; no fog was encountered here. 3. Detailed observations have been made on the temperature and relative humidity during 3-week periods in the undergrowth of the two forests and also in large clearings where the conditions are believed to have approximated to those in the upper part of the forest canopy. 4. On fog-bound days the temperature change in the montane forest undergrowth is very small and the relative humidity rarely falls below 95{\%}. On fog-free days the diurnal range in temperature and the minimum relative humidity are about the same as on average days in the lowland forest. A similar parallel is found for conditions in the clearings. 5. The daily march of atmospheric conditions is followed in detail. On fog-free days in the montane forest and on average days in the lowland it approaches that already described for lowland forests elsewhere during the dry season; on fog-bound days in the montane forest it approaches that described for lowland forests in the wet season. The severely desiccating periods, taken arbitrarily as those with relative humidity {\$}\backslasheqslantless 80{\%}{\$} , are of approximately equal duration and frequency on fog-free days in the montane forest and on average days in the lowland. 6. It is shown that the results probably represent a generally valid comparison of montane and lowland forest climates in the part of Ecuador visited. The importance and general occurrence of dry periods as well as frequent fog, even in Upper Montane Forest, is stressed. 7. The factors controlling the distribution of the three rain forest formation-types on tropical mountains (Lowland, Lower Montane and Upper Montane) are discussed. A consideration of the Massenerhebung effect leads to the conclusion that the forest types are primarily correlated with the frequency of fog (stratus or cumulus cloud close to the ground) rather than with any aspect of the temperature regime. The Massenerhebung effect arises in the tropics because clouds form at lower altitudes where the air masses are moister before lifting and cooling, i.e. when over the sea or approaching the foothills of a large massif. Exposure to high winds and soil factors are important in producing stunted facies of each of the three types, including so-called `Elfin woodland'. 8. The greater abundance of epiphytes in the montane forest than in the lowland is related to the more frequent wetting with liquid water from fog rather than to a constantly higher humidity.

abstract = {We studied soil phosphorus (P) fractionation and P-use efficiencies (PUEs) of rainforests along altitudinal gradients (700-3100 m) on two types of parental rocks (sedimentary versus ultrabasic) on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. Sedimentary rocks were known to contain more quartz (which does not adsorb P) than ultrabasic rocks. The pool (top 30 cm) of total P was always greater on sedimentary (ranging from 34.9 to 72.6 g m(-2)) than on ultrabasic (9.0-29.2 g m(-2)) rocks at comparable altitudes. Accordingly, the pools of organic P and labile inorganic P were always greater on sedimentary than on ultrabasic rocks. The pool of primary mineral, calcium P increased upslope from 1.7 to 4.3 g m(-2) on sedimentary rock, suggesting that the altitudinal sequence of the sites reflected a decreasing magnitude of soil weathering upslope. The pool of calcium P on ultrabasic rock did not vary consistently with altitude (1.2-2.8 g m(-2)), probably reflecting the greater between-site variability of primary mineral P in parent rocks. When all sites were compared, the pool of most labile, bicarbonate-extracted inorganic P increased (ranging from 0.02 to 1.85 g m(-2)) with increasing calcium P. Calcium P was therefore considered to be an important P source to the biota on Kinabalu. Gross patterns in the variation of PUE (indexed as the reciprocal of the P concentration in litter) were best explained by the pool size of actively cycling P (total P minus occluded inorganic P). PUE, however, demonstrated distinct altitudinal patterns to generate an intricate conrol of P use pattern by soil P pools and altitude.},

abstract = {Emerging international policy aimed at reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in developing countries, has resulted in numerous studies on above-ground live carbon (AGC) in tropical forests. However, few studies have addressed the relative importance of disturbance, topography, climate, soil and methods for stem measurement, on the estimation of AGC, or the costs of improving AGC estimates by altering sample regimes. We established 18 one hectare plots containing 7201 stems, stratified along forested elevation gradients in Tanzania. We recorded a broad set of physical, climatic and edaphic predictors of AGC and tree stature. AGC estimates using stem diameter, height and wood density, gave a mean value of 174.6tha -1, compared with 229.6tha -1 when height was excluded. Regression models revealed that stems were tallest for a given diameter at mid-elevation (1000-1250m), on south-facing slopes, and without past logging. High AGC was strongly associated with shallow slopes, followed by intermediate elevation, elephant absence, low potential evapotranspiration and low soil pH. Further regression models to investigate the structural habitat features associated with AGC, revealed significant positive influence of basal area, stem density, and height:diameter ratio, rather than the mean wood density of species present. Large stems (≥70cmdbh; 4.6{\%} of stems) contained 52{\%} of AGC in all plots, declining to 36{\%} in lowland plots. We discuss the cost:benefit of different measurements and recommend a tiered approach to AGC monitoring, depending on available resources. AGC assessments in African forests could exclude small stems, but should aim to record disturbance, topography and species. Stem height is vital for AGC estimation and valuation; when excluding height our 55tha -1 over-estimation of AGC would have over-valued the carbon resource by 24{\%} (US{\$}3300ha -1). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

A synthesis of the monitoring results and all relevant ecological knowledge on the Scheldt allowed to identify opportunities to optimize its management. The results show that the effect of discharge on salinity has a distinct maximum in the polyhaline to mesohaline transition area. Oxygen conditions, nitrogen removal and phytoplankton regulation can be enhanced and improved through management measures within the estuary. To lower carbon and phosphorous loads however measures should be taken within the catchment. To restore most of its ecological functions the estuary needs more space. Optimal locations to address specific functions can be derived from the monitoring results.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Senckenberg Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Pilot studies are used to assess different sampling and monitoring protocols when developing long-term monitoring programs (LTMPs). Considering that the ultimate goal of LTMPs is preservation-orientated, non-destructive sampling methods are favoured. For coral reef fishes, underwater visual censuses (UVCs) have become the method of choice for surveying shallow, highly-diverse reefs. This study assessed three different UVC transect types to monitor high-latitude western Indian Ocean coral reefs; these were slate, photo and video transects. Slate data were analysed with CountN (all fish observed), while footage from reviewable photo and video transects was analysed by both CountN and MaxN (a single frame with the most fish per species), resulting in an assessment of five transect-type analysis technique combinations; slate, photo-CountN, video-CountN, photo-MaxN and video-MaxN. Video-CountN transects had the highest estimates of richness and abundance, the lowest variability, and the most representative diversity. Video-CountN transects were also the most efficient in that the time taken to analyse footage was comparable to the other combinations considered, the proportion of unidentifiable individuals was low, and it required the lowest sample size to achieve an acceptable statistical power. Video-CountN transecting is therefore recommended as the most appropriate method for conducting UVCs of high-latitude coral reef fishes in the southwestern Indian Ocean.},

abstract = {The mechanisms which control the formation and maintenance of pool-riffles are fundamental aspects of channel form and process. Most of the previous investigations on pool-riffle sequences have focused on alluvial rivers, and relatively few exist on the maintenance of these bedforms in boulder-bed channels. Here, we use a high-resolution two-dimensional flow model to investigate the interactions among large roughness elements, channel hydraulics, and the maintenance of a forced pool-riffle sequence in a boulder-bed stream. Model output indicates that at low discharge, a peak zone of shear stress and velocity occurs over the riffle. At or near bankfull discharge, the peak in velocity and shear stress is found at the pool head because of strong flow convergence created by large roughness elements. The strength of flow convergence is enhanced during model simulations of bankfull flow, resulting in a narrow, high velocity core that is translated through the pool head and pool center. The jet is strengthened by a backwater effect upstream of the constriction and the development of an eddy zone on the lee side of the boulder. The extent of flow convergence and divergence is quantified by identifying the effective width, defined here as the width which conveys 90{\%} of the highest modeled velocities. At low flow, the ratio of effective width between the pool and riffle is roughly 1:1, indicating little flow convergence or divergence. At bankfull discharge, the ratio of effective width is approximately 1:3 between the pool and downstream riffle, illustrating the strong flow convergence at the pool head. The effective width tends to equalize again with a ratio of 1:1 between the pool and riffle during a modeled discharge of a five-year flood, as the large roughness elements above the pool become drowned out. Results suggest that forced pool-riffle sequences in boulder-bed streams are maintained by flows at or near bankfull discharge because of stage-dependent variability in depth-averaged velocity and tractive force. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {For the calibration of any model, measurements are necessary. As measurements are expensive, it is of interest to determine beforehand which kind of samples will provide maximal information. Using a criterion related to the Fisher information matrix as a measure for information content, it is possible to design a sampling scheme that will enable the most precise parameter estimates. This approach was applied to a reactive transport model (based on the Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model, SLIM) of Escherichia coli concentrations in the Scheldt Estuary. As this estuary is highly influenced by the tide, it is expected that careful timing of the samples with respect to the tidal cycle can have an effect on the quality of the data. The timing and also the positioning of samples were optimised according to the proposed criterion. In the investigated case studies the precision of the estimated parameters could be improved by up to a factor of ten, confirming the usefulness of this approach to maximize the amount of information that can be retrieved from a fixed number of samples. Precise parameter values will result in more reliable model simulations, which can be used for interpretation, or can in turn serve to plan subsequent sampling campaigns to further constrain the model parameters. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This chapter analyses the climatic conditions prevailing at sites where tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) have been reported. Spatial data-sets of climate were used to describe the climate at 477 cloud forest sites identified by United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)-WCMC. Some 85{\%} of the sites are found at altitudes between 400 and 2800 m a.s.l., with an average altitude of 1700 m. The range of altitudes at which cloud forests are found is extensive (220–5005 m). The climate of cloud forests is highly variable from site to site, with an average rainfall of ∼2000 mm year−1 and an average temperature of 17{\textperiodcentered}7 °C. In addition, cloud forests are found in seasonal and aseasonal environments alike, both in terms of rainfall and temperature. There are some clear differences in the climates of cloud forests found in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and those in Asia. Cloud forests are found to be wetter (with incident rainfall being 184 mm year−1 higher on average), cooler (by 4{\textperiodcentered}2 °C on average), and less seasonally variable than other montane forests not affected significantly by fog and low cloud. Cloud forests are also almost completely confined to a zone within 350 km from the nearest coast. Finally, the climatic representativity of 14 intensively studied cloud forest sites (ISS) was analysed, as a group, the sites provided a fair representation of the climates found in cloud forests, evenly covering the ranges in temperature and rainfall. The majority of cloud forest sites occur in regions with 2000–2600 mm of rainfall and annual mean temperatures (Tmean) of 14–18 °C. Relatively dry cloud forest sites ({\textless}1000 mm of rain year−1) are under-represented in the UNEP-WCMC data-base. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Using data from a three-year study on 34 neighboring ponds in an interconnected pond system, we tested whether zooplankton communities show a metacommunity structure, how much variation in zooplankton community structure is related to local environmental factors vs. spatial configuration (taking into account the dispersal pathways), and what environmental variables are the locally structuring forces. In three different years, we found evidence for a metacommunity structure. We also found that spatial and environmental components act independently of each other due to the small Geographic area and the high dispersal rates in this system. Despite these homogenizing forces. local environmental variables (associated with alternative equilibria in shallow lakes) were strongly related with zooplankton community structure in the studied years. This suggests that, even in this system of highly interconnected ponds, local environmental constraints can be strong enough to structure local communities.},

abstract = {A directional change in tropical-forest productivity, a large component in the global carbon budget, would affect the rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO2]). One current hypothesis is that " CO2fertilization" has been increasing tropical-forest productivity. Some lines of evidence instead suggest climate-driven productivity declines. Relevant direct field observations remain extremely limited for this biome. Using a unique long-term record of annual field measurements, we assessed annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and its relation to climatic factors and [CO2] in a neotropical rainforest through 1997–2009. Over this 12-yr period, annual productivity did not increase, as would be expected with a dominant “CO2-fertilization” effect. Instead, the negative responses of ANPP components to climatic stress far exceeded the small positive responses associated with increasing [CO2]. Annual aboveground biomass production was well-explained (73{\%}) by the independent negative effects of increasing minimum temperatures and greater dry-season water-stress. The long-term records enable a first field-based estimate of the [CO2]-response of tropical-forest ANPP: 5.24 g m-2 yr -1 yr -1 (the summed [CO2]-associated increases in two of the four production components; the largest component, leaf litterfall, showed no [CO2] association). If confirmed by longer data-series, such a small response from a fertile tropical rainforest would indicate that current global models overestimate the benefits from “CO2 fertilization” for this biome, where most forests' poorer nutrient status more strongly constrain productivity responses to increasing [CO2]. Given the rapidly intensifying warming across tropical regions, tropical-forest productivity could sharply decline through coming decades.},

abstract = {Aim To explain the relationship between topography, prevailing winds and precipitation in order to identify regions with contrasting precipitation regimes and then compare floristic similarity among regions in the context of climate change. Location Eastern slope of the tropical Andes, South America. Methods We used information sources in the public domain to identify the relationship between geology, topography, prevailing wind patterns and precipitation. Areas with contrasting precipitation regimes were identified and compared for their floristic similarity. Results We identify spatially separate super-humid, humid and relatively dry regions on the eastern slope of the Andes and show how they are formed by the interaction of prevailing winds, diurnally varying atmospheric circulations and the local topography of the Andes. One key aspect related to the formation of these climatically distinct regions is the South American low-level jet (SALLJ), a relatively steady wind gyre that flows pole-ward along the eastern slopes of the Andes and is part of the gyre associated with the Atlantic trade winds that cross the Amazon Basin. The strongest winds of the SALLJ occur near the 'elbow of the Andes' at 18 degrees S. Super-humid regions with mean annual precipitation greater than 3500 mm, are associated with a 'favourable' combination of topography, wind-flow orientation and local air circulation that favours ascent at certain hours of the day. Much drier regions, with mean annual precipitation less than 1500 mm, are associated with 'unfavourable' topographic orientation with respect to the mean winds and areas of reduced cloudiness produced by local breezes that moderate the cloudiness. We show the distribution of satellite-estimated frequency of cloudiness and offer hypotheses to explain the occurrence of these patterns and to explain regions of anomalously low precipitation in Bolivia and northern Peru. Floristic analysis shows that overall similarity among all circumscribed regions of this study is low; however, similarity among super-humid and humid regions is greater when compared with similarity among dry regions. Spatially separate areas with humid and super-humid precipitation regimes show similarity gradients that are correlated with latitude (proximity) and precipitation. Main conclusions The distribution of precipitation on the eastern slope of the Andes is not simply correlated with latitude, as is often assumed, but is the result of the interplay between wind and topography. Understanding the phenomena responsible for producing the observed precipitation patterns is important for mapping and modelling biodiversity, as well as for interpreting both past and future climate scenarios and the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Super-humid and dry regions have topographic characteristics that contribute to local climatic stability and may represent ancestral refugia for biodiversity; these regions are a conservation priority due to their unique climatic characteristics and the biodiversity associated with those characteristics.},

We estimated the loss of forest-derived soil C (light in C-13) and the accumulation of C from replicate sugar cane and pasture vegetation (heavy in C-13) using a stable C isotope technique. We also measured differences in the proportion of soil C derived from C-3 and C-4 plants across a land-use progression from agricultural fields through successional communities and undisturbed forest. Total soil C was 23 Mg/ha lower in the upper 30 cm following 50 yr of sugar cane production (24{\%} decrease) compared to old-growth forest. The net change (-0.4 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) in soil C consisted of 1.3 Mg/ha annual losses of original forest C and 0.9 Mg/ha annual gains of C from sugar cane. After 15 yr beneath pasture, soil C was 11 Mg/ha less in the upper 30 cm than beneath forest (12{\%} decrease). During that period, 33{\%} of the original forest C was lost, compared to 68{\%} released during 50 yr of sugar cane cultivation. Rate of forest C loss, C-4-C accumulation, and net soil C change differed little between two distinct pasture types. Setaria sphacelata pasture and a traditional mixed- species pasture both contained more total soil C and added C-4- C more rapidly than sugar cane. Under second-growth forest, soil C increased by 1.9 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1), the result of a 3 Mg/ha annual increase in C, carbon and a 1.1 Mg/ha annual loss of C-4 carbon. The total soil C pool returned to preclearing levels within 20 yr. While widespread reforestation may be thwarted by high demands for land in northwestern Ecuador, agricultural land-use options exist that can contribute to increased soil C stocks.},

abstract = {Background: The Ethiopian cereal teff (Eragrostis tef (Zuccagni) Trotter), traditionally grown under short days (11-13. h) (SD), is currently introduced into NW Europe where the early phases of the growing season are characterized by long days (15-17. h) (LD). This paper analyzes to what degree teff's ontogeny and morphology are day length sensitive. Methods: To analyze the day length response of teff considering panicle initiation, time to heading, number of phytomers, plant height and biomass, growth chamber and greenhouse experiments were conducted. In these experiments two Ethiopian cultivars, Gibe and Ziquala, and two cultivars from a Dutch breeding programme, Ayana and 04T19, were exposed to day lengths of 9, 10.5, 12, 13.5, 15, 16.5 and 18. h. Key results: The Ethiopian cultivars of teff showed a stronger photoperiod response than the Dutch cultivars. For example, time to heading for Ziquala was 88. d under LD but 37. d under SD whereas for Ayana it was 45. d under LD and 29. d under SD. Time to heading could be described using a smooth logistic function consisting of four biologically interpretable parameters. Application of the same function to literature data of the short day plants: rice (Oryza sativa) and soya bean (Glycine max), and the long day plants: wheat (Triticum aestivum) and wild oat (Avena fatua) showed the broader applicability of the approach. Not only panicle initiation of teff, but also development and outgrowth of the panicle were influenced by photoperiod. Plant-to-plant variation in time to heading, the total number of phytomers per shoot, the number of elongated internodes and biomass were higher in LD than in SD treatments for all cultivars. Conclusions: This paper provides a detailed description and quantification of the response of teff to day length. The smooth logistic function presented is applicable not only for teff, but also for other short day (rice and soya bean) and long day (wheat and wild oat) species. We revealed, moreover, genetic variation in day length sensitivity, including a strain that showed almost day length neutral behaviour. The ample genetic variation between cultivars suggests there is a basis for breeding for high yielding cultivars for the northern latitudes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Estimates of forest biomass are needed for tracking changes in C stocks, as well as for other purposes. A common method for estimating forest biomass is through use of allometric equations which relate the biomass of individual trees to easily obtainable non-destructive measurements, such as diameter. A common form is B=aD6 for biomass B, diameter D and parameters a and b. Field data collected in Sumatra and compared with previously published data show that the values of a and b vary between sites. This variation is likely to be the major source of uncertainty if biomass estimates are produced using equations that are not calibrated for individual sites. However, calibration by collection of Band D data for each site is unrealistic, requiring destructive measures. Methods of choosing values for a and b are, therefore, proposed that do not require destructive measurements. The parameter b can be estimated from the site-specific relationship between height (H) and diameter, H=kDc as b=2+c. The parameter a can be estimated from the average wood density (p) at the site as a=rp, where r is expected to be relatively stable across sites. The allometric equation proposed is therefore B=rpD2+c. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In recent years the use of species distribution models by ecologists and conservation managers has increased considerably, along with an awareness of the need to provide accuracy assessment for predictions of such models. The kappa statistic is the most widely used measure for the performance of models generating presence2013absence predictions, but several studies have criticized it for being inherently dependent on prevalence, and argued that this dependency introduces statistical artefacts to estimates of predictive accuracy. This criticism has been supported recently by computer simulations showing that kappa responds to the prevalence of the modelled species in a unimodal fashion. In this paper we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed dependence of kappa on prevalence, and introduce into ecology an alternative measure of accuracy, the true skill statistic (TSS), which corrects for this dependence while still keeping all the advantages of kappa. We also compare the responses of kappa and TSS to prevalence using empirical data, by modelling distribution patterns of 128 species of woody plant in Israel. The theoretical analysis shows that kappa responds in a unimodal fashion to variation in prevalence and that the level of prevalence that maximizes kappa depends on the ratio between sensitivity (the proportion of correctly predicted presences) and specificity (the proportion of correctly predicted absences). In contrast, TSS is independent of prevalence. When the two measures of accuracy were compared using empirical data, kappa showed a unimodal response to prevalence, in agreement with the theoretical analysis. TSS showed a decreasing linear response to prevalence, a result we interpret as reflecting true ecological phenomena rather than a statistical artefact. This interpretation is supported by the fact that a similar pattern was found for the area under the ROC curve, a measure known to be independent of prevalence. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide theoretical and empirical evidence that kappa, one of the most widely used measures of model performance in ecology, has serious limitations that make it unsuitable for such applications. The alternative we suggest, TSS, compensates for the shortcomings of kappa while keeping all of its advantages. We therefore recommend the TSS as a simple and intuitive measure for the performance of species distribution models when predictions are expressed as presence2013absence maps.

abstract = {Due to wide range of experimental techniques reported in the literature for determining interrill erodibility and soil loss values, meaningful comparisons between experiments often cannot be made. Furthermore, inaccurate concepts are developed because erosion processes are dependent upon methodologies. The purpose of this paper is to discuss problems related to both laboratory and field rainfall simulator experiments. Rainfall simulators cannot duplicate a wide range of rainfall intensities and, at the same time, have similar energies as natural rainstorms, unless several different nozzles are used. Rainfall intensity in most simulators is created by varying the frequency of spray oscillation. This intermittent spray characteristic of most simulators, and the constant drop size characteristic of other simulators, greatly affects results. Erosion pan design for laboratory studies and preparation of soil samples placed in the pans also can influence erosion results. We conclude that standardization of rainfall simulator design and test procedures will allow better comparison of erosion results to be made among researchers.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are a critical component of the global carbon cycle and their response to environmental change will play a key role in determining future concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Increasing primary productivity in tropical forests over recent decades has been attributed to CO2 fertilization, and greater biomass in tropical forests could represent a substantial sink for carbon in the future. However, the carbon sequestration capacity of tropical forest soils is uncertain and feedbacks between increased plant productivity and soil carbon dynamics remain unexplored. Here, we show that experimentally increasing litterfall in a lowland tropical forest enhanced carbon release from the soil. Using a large-scale litter manipulation experiment combined with carbon isotope measurements, we found that the efflux of CO2 derived from soil organic carbon was significantly increased by litter addition. Furthermore, this effect was sustained over several years. We predict that a future increase in litterfall of 30{\%} with an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 150 ppm could release about 0.6 t C ha-1 yr-1 from the soil, partially offsetting predicted net gains in carbon storage. Thus, it is essential that plant–soil feedbacks are taken into account in predictions of the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: We used a 3 yr data set of NOAA-AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) imagery to investigate cloud frequency, cloud-top height and cloud liquid water path for the Ecuadorean area, with special reference to a specific region in the Andes of southern Ecuador. In general, the seasonal cycle of cloudiness is significantly correlated to the spatial occurrence of the rainy seasons. However, we found that the complex topography of the Andes with dynamic effects at the windward and lee sides, as well as thermal breeze-systems, cause a specific spatial structure of cloud frequency and cloud properties. For instance, the eastern Andean slopes are mainly affected by a strong dynamic barrage effect of the easterlies, where a line of high cloud frequency occurs in the area of the Andes-occurring system (AOS) rain band. Average cloud-top height reveals a clear divi- sion between the Pacific area west of the western Cordillera chain, characterised by lower and more stratiform clouds, and the eastern parts of the country where an increase in average cloud-top height towards the Amazon indicates an intensification of convective cloud formation processes. This corre- sponds with the higher amounts of cloud liquid path over the Amazon, which illustrates that the cloud water cycle is more intensive in comparison to the Ecuadorian coastal plains},

abstract = {Fluvial disconnectivity can have important impacts on fish populations, including hindering movement between habitats required for different ontogenic stages. Recruitment of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) has reduced by over 90{\%} since the early 1980's, in part due to the effect of riverine barriers on its catadromous migration. There is a legislative requirement to restore free passage, increase habitat availability, and limit anthropogenic losses at intakes to aid eel recovery and good ecological status; necessitating an improved understanding of underlying processes. Escapement, route choice, delay at structures, and entrainment at water abstraction points of downstream migrating silver eels were examined using acoustic and Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) telemetry in the heavily regulated lower river Stour, UK. Downstream migrating adult eel (n=. 69) were trapped approximately 10. km upstream of the tidal limit, surgically implanted with an acoustic transducer and PIT transponder, and released between October and December in 2009 and 2010. Movements of tagged individuals were monitored by a linear array of 19 fixed acoustic receivers extending from the release site, through the last 9.2. km of the freshwater catchment. Three groups of water control structures, two water abstraction intakes and several possible routes of migration are present in the reach. Seventy six and 65{\%} of tagged eels escaped from the study reach in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Entrainment at a single intake was the principal cause of loss and positively related to rapid increases in abstraction whilst eels were in the vicinity of the intake. Route choice into the estuary was dependent on discharge over a large intertidal weir; opening regimes of a tidal gate at the termination of the alternative channel; and abstraction rate at a nearby water intake. Long delays (up to 68.5 days) and recurrent behaviour were associated with several structures in the study reach; high variability between individuals reflected the management of spill at weirs. Potential scenarios for minimising entrainment and delay through integrated management of water level control structures and abstraction rates are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Strategies aimed at reducing the degradation of water quality and predicting future changes in surface waters resulting from natural and anthropogenic forcing rely on the ability to track water quality changes, and to accurately quantify the distribution of water quality attributes. The three components of this dissertation focus on developing geostatistical data fusion methods that make optimal use of the available monitoring data in the Passaic River, Lake Erie, and the Chesapeake Bay, respectively.   The first component presents a method for accurately estimating the spatial distribution of the total organic carbon in the sediments of the Passaic River using a dataset with non-uniform resolution. Estimating the spatial distribution of water sediment attributes at a uniform spatial resolution is often required for site characterizations and the design of appropriate risk-based remediation alternatives. Using a pseudodata example, a noval geostatisitical downscaling approach is shown to yield better estimates with a more accurate assessment of uncertainties, relative to traditional kriging methods. When applied to the estimation of the distribution of total organic carbon, geostatistical downscaling shows that the uncertainty associated with the spatial distribution of attribute is higher than would have been assumed if a kriging approach had been applied.   The second and third components explore the degradation of water quality in time and space. Specifically, hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) has been observed in Lake Erie and Chesapeake Bay since the early 1900s, leading to negative impacts such as ecosystem habitat degradation, altered migration patterns, and decreased fishery production. The interannual variability in hypoxic extent since mid-1980s in these two systems is quantified by combining spatially explicit auxiliary data with in situ dissolved oxygen measurements. The significance of nutrient loading, weather patterns, and stratification in explaining hypoxia in these systems is also explored. This research points to strong meteorological controls on hypoxia, through impacts on stratification and nutrient loading, in addition to the impact of anthropogenic activities.    Overall, the developed geostatistical data fusion methods are shown to provide a means for producing reliable estimates of water quality attributes along with their associated uncertainties.},

@article{Gunter2007,
abstract = {Abstract In spite of its high diversity the forests in Southern Ecuador are highly endangered by deforestation. One of the main reasons for the loss of forests is the conversion into pastures. Due to their fast degradation, the pastures are abandoned after several years and form an increasing area of unproductive land. The remoteness from existing forest edges is discussed as one reason for the very slow natural reforestation of these areas. In this study we analyzed the regeneration of a secondary forest after approx. 38 years of succession in relation to the distance from the surrounding forest. We revealed that regeneration was rather slow. Especially larger trees with dbh textgreater 10 cm were very scarce. Only Dioicodendron dioicum, Graffenrieda emarginata and Clusia sp. achieved larger diameters. The basal area of the secondary forest is still far beyond the original level in the primary forest. The number of species on plot level and the Shannon index were significantly lower in the secondary forest compared to the primary forest. The total number of species decreased from 47 to 31 with increasing distance from the forest edge and the similarity of species composition to the upper story declined to a level of 56.4 (Srensen). Alzatea verticillata, Macrocarpea revoluta and Palicourea andaluciana had significantly higher abundances in the succession stages than in the natural forest. The most abundant species in all regeneration plots, G. emarginata and Purdiea nutans, seem to be generalists as they did not show preference either to natural forest or successional stages.},

abstract = {1 We measured above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and ecosystem structure and processes in eight rain forest stands at four elevations (700, 1700, 2700 and 3100 m) and on two geological substrates (sedimentary vs. ultrabasic rock) on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. 2 All ultrabasic sites had smaller pools of total soil phosphorus (P) and of labile inorganic P than did the sedimentary sites at the same altitudes. We predicted that the magnitude of altitudinal changes in ANPP would be less on ultrabasic than on sedimentary substrates, reflecting lower temperature dependency of ANPP under stronger P limitation. 3 Although ANPP declined with increasing altitude on both substrates, the slopes of the two regression lines were similar. The intercept was, however, marginally greater on sedimentary than on ultrabasic substrate. 4 Stand-level nutrient-use efficiencies (the ratio of litterfall mass to nutrient return) for N and P were only affected by altitude on ultrabasic substrate where they increased exponentially. Mean foliar N and P contents per unit leaf area of the canopy species increased with altitude on both substrates, but differed between substrates at the same altitude only for P (lower on ultrabasic). 5 Leaf area index (LAI) decreased upslope on both substrates. We assumed that half of primary production was allocated below-ground in order to evaluate stand level net assimilation rate (NAR). This was nearly constant on sedimentary substrate, but declined linearly with increasing altitude on ultrabasic substrate, where it may have to be added to LAI to explain ANPP patterns. 6 We suggest that on sedimentary substrate trees may be able to maintain NAR under colder environments by increasing foliar N and P per unit leaf area, but P deficiency prevents them from adjusting on ultrabasic substrate.},

If a randomsample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {Ecologists and physiologists have documented extensive variation in water use efficiency (WUE) in Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as association of WUE with climatic variation. Here, we demonstrate correlations of whole-plant transpiration efficiency and carbon isotope composition ($\delta$(13)C) among life history classes of A. thaliana. We also use a whole-plant cuvette to examine patterns of co-variation in component traits of WUE and $\delta$(13)C. We find that stomatal conductance (g s) explains more variation in WUE than does A. Overall, there was a strong genetic correlation between A and g s, consistent with selection acting on the ratio of these traits. At a more detailed level, genetic variation in A was due to underlying variation in both maximal rate of carboxylation (V cmax) and maximum electron transport rate (Jmax). We also found strong effects of leaf anatomy, where lines with lower WUE had higher leaf water content (LWC) and specific leaf area (SLA), suggesting a role for mesophyll conductance (g m) in variation of WUE. We hypothesize that this is due to an effect through g m, and test this hypothesis using the abi4 mutant. We show that mutants of ABI4 have higher SLA, LWC, and g m than wild-type, consistent with variation in leaf anatomy causing variation in g m and $\delta$(13)C. These functional data also add further support to the central, integrative role of ABI4 in simultaneously altering ABA sensitivity, sugar signaling, and CO2 assimilation. Together our results highlight the need for a more holistic approach in functional studies, both for more accurate annotation of gene function and to understand co-limitations to plant growth and productivity.},

abstract = {We report on the development and validation of a coupled two- and one-dimensional finite-element model for the Scheldt tributaries, river, estuary and region of fresh water influence (ROFI). The hydrodynamic equations are solved on a single, unstructured, multi-scale mesh stretching from the shelf break to the Scheldt tributaries. The tide is forced on the shelf break and propagates upstream in the riverine network. Upstream boundaries lie on sluices or outside of the region of tidal dominance where daily averaged discharges are imposed. Two-dimensional, depth-averaged shallow water equations are solved by means of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method over the marine and estuarine parts of the computational domain. In the rivers, however, one-dimensional equations are dealt with using the DG method with the addition of a technique to cope with confluence points. Model parameters are carefully calibrated, leading to the simulation of wind- and tide-forced flows that are in excellent agreement with available data. The diffusivity in the transport equation is calibrated using time series of salinity at various locations in the estuary. Finally, the Lagrangian residual transport in the estuary and the adjacent coastal zone is investigated. This work is a major step towards an integrated model for studying the dynamics of waterborne contaminants and the water renewal timescales in the Scheldt land-sea continuum. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aim The purpose of this study was to create predictive species distribution models (SDMs) for temperate reef-associated fish species densities and fish assemblage diversity and richness to aid in marine conservation and spatial planning. Location California, USA. Methods Using generalized additive models, we associated fish species densities and assemblage characteristics with seafloor structure, giant kelp biomass and wave climate and used these associations to predict the distribution and assemblage structure across the study area. We tested the accuracy of these predicted extrapolations using an independent data set. The SDMs were also used to estimate larger scale abundances to compare with other estimates of species abundance (uniform density extrapolation over rocky reef and density extrapolations taking into account variations in geomorphic structure). Results The SDMs successfully modelled the species–habitat relationships of seven rocky reef-associated fish species and showed that species' densities differed in their relationships with environmental variables. The predictive accuracy of the SDMs ranged from 0.26 to 0.60 (Pearson's r correlation between observed and predicted density values). The SDMs created for the fish assemblage-level variables had higher prediction accuracies with Pearson's r values of 0.61 for diversity and 0.71 for richness. The comparisons of the different methods for extrapolating species densities over a single marine protected area varied greatly in their abundance estimates with the uniform extrapolation (density values extrapolated evenly over the rocky reef) always estimating much greater abundances. The other two methods, which took into account variation in the geomorphic structure of the reef, provided much lower abundance estimates. Main conclusions Species distribution models that combine geomorphic, oceanographic and biogenic habitat variables can reliably predict spatial patterns of species density and assemblage attributes of temperate reef fishes at spatial scales of 50 m. Thus, SDMs show great promise for informing spatial and ecosystem-based approaches to conservation and fisheries management.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to predict the future distribution of an invasive macroinvertebrate species, Dikerogammarus villosus, under chang- ing environmental conditions. For this, we used an integrated modelling approach. First, a habitat suitability model (HSM) was constructed on the basis of a regression tree model, to determine the preferred chemical water quality conditions. Subsequently, this HSM was combined with a chemical water quality model that makes predictions on future water quality scenarios for the year 2015 and 2027. It was expected that the area of suitable habitat of D. villosus would increase with improving water quality conditions in the future. Finally, migration speed was incorporated to model the spatial–temporal spread of D. villosus based on a network analysis. On the basis of monitoring data of Flanders (Belgium), it was calculated that D. villosus is able to spread with an average speed of 5 kmyear?1.The model simulations indicate that the species is primarily present in large rivers and canals with a good chemical water quality. With improving water quality, the species will be able to colonize additional watercourses, mainly because of a decrease in chemical oxygen demand and orthophosphate concentration. A validation based on the observed occurrence shows that the model accurately predicts areas with a high suitability that are most likely to be invaded by D. villosus. Our integrated modelling approach is useful as a practical method to perform risk assessment for watercourses that are vulnerable to invasions not only in Flanders but also in the whole world.

Data was analysed using a multilevel modelling approach, allowing a separation of gradients within individual tree canopies (within-tree gradients) as opposed to stand level gradients occurring because of systematic differences occurring between different trees of different heights (between-tree gradients). Significant positive within-tree gradients (i.e. increasing values with increasing sampling height) were observed for MA and [C]DW (the subscript denoting on a dry weight basis) with negative within-tree gradients observed for $\delta$13C, [Mg]DW and [K]DW. No significant within-tree gradients were observed for [N]DW, [P]DW or [Ca]DW. The magnitudes of between-tree gradients were not significantly different to the within-tree gradients for MA, $\delta$13C, [C]DW, [K]DW, [N]DW, [P]DW and [Ca]DW.

This was best associated with the overall average [P]A for each tree, this also being considered to be a surrogate for a tree's average leaf area based photosynthetic capacity, Amax. A new model is presented which is in agreement with the above observations. The model predicts that trees characterised by a low upper canopy Amax should have shallow, or even non-existent, within-canopy gradients in Amax, with optimal intra-canopy gradients becoming sharper as a tree's upper canopy Amax increases. Nevertheless, in all cases it is predicted that the optimal within-canopy gradient in Amax should be substantially less than for photon irradiance. Although this is also shown to be consistent with numerous observations as illustrated by a literature survey of gradients in photosynthetic capacity for broadleaf trees, it is also in contrast to previously held notions of optimality. A new equation relating gradients in photosynthetic capacity within broadleaf tree canopies to the photosynthetic capacity of their upper canopy leaves is presented.},

abstract = {The sampling efficiencies of commercial standard fish traps and baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) were compared by examining the diversity and relative abundance of tropical demersal fish that each method sampled on the north-western shelf (40-60. m) of Western Australia. Stereo-BRUVs recorded many more species (91 species from 32 families) than commercial fish traps (30 species and 15 families). Stereo-BRUVs also sampled many more individuals (mean 36.55 ± 5.91 SE) than fish traps (mean 12.30 ± 1.40 SE). This suggests stereo-BRUVs would be more capable of detecting changes in the relative abundance of species over time. Data from four commercially important species (Epinephelus bilobatus, Epinephelus multinotatus, Lethrinus punctulatus and Lutjanus russelli) revealed that stereo-BRUVs had much greater statistical power to detect change than an equivalent number of samples from fish traps. In contrast, fish traps had a greater statistical power to detect change for a fifth target species, Lutjanus sebae. For two commonly sampled species, Abalistes stellatus 11Usage follows CAABcodes (Rees, A.J.J., Yearsley, G.K., Gowlett-Holmes, K. and Pogonoski, J. Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota (on-line version). CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, World Wide Web electronic publication, 1999 onwards. Available at: http://www.cmar.csiro.au/caab/.). and Lethrinus punctulatus, stereo-BRUVs sampled a smaller mean length than fish traps while for a third species, Lutjanus sebae, stereo-BRUVs recorded a larger mean length. The length frequencies for these species were not significantly different between methods, although stereo-BRUVs sampled a much larger range of lengths than was captured in traps. This study demonstrates that stereo-BRUVs are potentially a much more powerful technique than fish traps for assessing species richness, relative abundance and size structure in multi-species fisheries in north-western Australia. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Tropical rain forests play a dominant role in global biosphere-atmosphere CO(2) exchange. Although climate and nutrient availability regulate net primary production (NPP) and decomposition in all terrestrial ecosystems, the nature and extent of such controls in tropical forests remain poorly resolved. We conducted a meta-analysis of carbon-nutrient-climate relationships in 113 sites across the tropical forest biome. Our analyses showed that mean annual temperature was the strongest predictor of aboveground NPP (ANPP) across all tropical forests, but this relationship was driven by distinct temperature differences between upland and lowland forests. Within lowland forests ({\textless} 1000 m), a regression tree analysis revealed that foliar and soil-based measurements of phosphorus (P) were the only variables that explained a significant proportion of the variation in ANPP, although the relationships were weak. However, foliar P, foliar nitrogen (N), litter decomposition rate (k), soil N and soil respiration were all directly related with total surface (0-10 cm) soil P concentrations. Our analysis provides some evidence that P availability regulates NPP and other ecosystem processes in lowland tropical forests, but more importantly, underscores the need for a series of large-scale nutrient manipulations - especially in lowland forests - to elucidate the most important nutrient interactions and controls.},

abstract = {We revisit the relationship between plant water use efficiency and carbon isotope signatures (delta(13)C) of plant material. Based on the definitions of intrinsic, instantaneous and integrated water use efficiency, we discuss the implications for interpreting delta(13)C data from leaf to landscape levels, and across diurnal to decadal timescales. Previous studies have often applied a simplified, linear relationship between delta(13)C, ratios of intercellular to ambient CO(2) mole fraction (C (i)/C (a)), and water use efficiency. In contrast, photosynthetic (13)C discrimination (Delta) is sensitive to the ratio of the chloroplast to ambient CO(2) mole fraction, C (c)/C (a) (rather than C (i)/C (a)) and, consequently, to mesophyll conductance. Because mesophyll conductance may differ between species and over time, it is not possible to determine C (c)/C (a) from the same gas exchange measurements as C (i)/C (a). On the other hand, water use efficiency at the leaf level depends on evaporative demand, which does not directly affect Delta. Water use efficiency and Delta can thus vary independently, making it difficult to obtain trends in water use efficiency from delta(13)C data. As an alternative approach, we offer a model available at http://carbonisotopes.googlepages.com to explore how water use efficiency and (13)C discrimination are related across leaf and canopy scales. The model provides a tool to investigate whether trends in Delta indicate changes in leaf functional traits and/or environmental conditions during leaf growth, and how they are associated with trends in plant water use efficiency. The model can be used, for example, to examine whether trends in delta(13)C signatures obtained from tree rings imply changes in tree water use efficiency in response to atmospheric CO(2) increase. This is crucial for predicting how plants may respond to future climate change.},

abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests are unique among terrestrial ecosystems in that they are strongly linked to regular cycles of cloud formation. We have explored changes in atmospheric parameters from global climate model simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum and for doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (2 x CO2) conditions which are associated with the height of this cloud formation, and hence the occurrence of intact cloud forests. These parameters include vertical profiles of absolute and relative humidity surfaces, as well as the warmth index(1), an empirical proxy of forest type. For the glacial simulations, the warmth index and absolute humidity suggest a downslope shift of cloud forests that agrees with the available palaeodata. For the 2 x CO2 scenario, the relative humidity surface is shifted upwards by hundreds of metres during the winter dry season when these forests typically rely most on the moisture from cloud contact. At the same time, an increase in the warmth index implies increased evapo-transpiration. This combination of reduced cloud contact and increased evapo-transpiration could have serious conservation implications, given that these ecosystems typically harbour a high proportion of endemic species and are often situated on mountain tops or ridge lines.},

Fryxell et Hasle was measured during nitrate assimilation under low light, a 12:12-h light:dark cycle, low temperature, or low iron conditions. The 15N/14N of the nitrate in the medium and the particulate matter both followed the predicted Rayleigh fractionation model, and the intracellular nitrate always had a higher 15N/14N than did the medium nitrate. When the experiments were compared, the results showed a negative correlation between the isotope fractionation factor and the difference in the 15N/14N between the two pools of nitrate. These observations imply that the variations in the isotope effect result from variations in the degree to which the fractionation by nitrate reductase is expressed outside the cell, which is, in turn, controlled by the rate of nitrate efflux relative to nitrate reduction. The low iron and low temperature experiments showed relatively small isotope effects but a large intracellular-medium difference in nitrate 15N/14N, consistent with a relative rate of efflux (compared with influx) that is small and similar to fast-growing cells. In contrast, large isotope effects and small intracellular-medium differences in nitrate 15N/14N were observed for low light and light:dark cycle grown cells and are explained by higher relative rates of nitrate efflux under these growth conditions.},

abstract = {An 18-month time series of temperature collected in the vicinity of the Guadalquivir estuary mouth has been analyzed to investigate tidal signals in the temperature records. Two sources of similar importance are acting jointly to produce these signals, the gravitational tide generating potential that acts through the tidal currents induced by the vertical tide at the estuary's mouth and the radiational potential whose origin is the sun's radiation. The most important signal is the radiational diurnal S1, which exhibits a seasonal modulation. The next one in importance is M2, introduced via the advective term, which shows semiannual modulation due to the change of sign of the horizontal temperature gradient. The S2 constituent is a mixture of radiational (via the first harmonic of S1) and gravitational contributions, the former being about twice the latter. The harmonic constants of all these constituents are time-dependent so that caution is needed to interpret results deduced from time series of few months. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.},

abstract = {The consequences of individual behaviour to dynamics of populations has been a critical question in fish ecology, but linking the two has proven difficult. A modification of Sale's habitat selection model provides a conceptual linkage for relating resource availability and individual habitat selection to exploratory behaviour, emigration and population-level responses. Whole-population experiments with pupfish Cyprinodon macularius that linked all factors along this resource to population continuum lend support to this conceptual model, and illustrate that emigration may be much more common in fish populations than considered in most individual- or population-based models. Accommodating emigration can enhance the ecological appropriateness of behavioural experiments and increase confidence in extrapolation of experimental observations to population-level effects. New experimental designs and advancing technologies offer avenues for assessing population consequences of habitat selection and emigration by individual fish. Emigration often is the key linkage between individual behaviour and population responses, and greater understanding of the underlying factors affecting this often-overlooked demographic parameter could offer new approaches for management and conservation of fishes.},

Due to the vast increase in global industrial output, rural to urban drift and the over-utilization of land and sea resources, the quality of water available to people has deteriorated greatly. The high use of fertilizers in farms and also other chemicals in sectors such as mining and construction have contributed immensely to the overall reduction of water quality globally. Water is an essential need for human survival and therefore there must be mechanisms put in place to vigorously test the quality of water that made available for drinking in town and city articulated supplies and as well as the rivers, creeks and shoreline that surround our towns and cities. The availability of good quality water is paramount in preventing outbreaks of water-borne diseases as well as improving the quality of life. Fiji Islands are located in the vast Pacific Ocean which requires a frequent data collecting network for the water quality monitoring and IoT and RS can improve the existing measurement.

abstract = {The demand for projections of the future distribution of biodiversity has triggered an upsurge in modelling at the crossroads between ecology and evolution. Despite the enthusiasm around these so-called biodiversity models, most approaches are still criticised for not integrating key processes known to shape species ranges and community structure. Developing an integrative modelling framework for biodiversity distribution promises to improve the reliability of predictions and to give a better understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species and communities under changing environments. In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure. We identify gaps in theory, quantitative knowledge and data availability hampering the development of an integrated modelling framework. We argue that model development relying on a strong theoretical foundation is essential to inspire new models, manage complexity and maintain tractability. We support our argument with an example of a novel integrated model for species distribution modelling, derived from metapopulation theory, which accounts for abiotic constraints, dispersal, biotic interactions and evolution under changing environmental conditions. We hope such a perspective will motivate exciting and novel research, and challenge others to improve on our proposed approach.},

In many cases, the sediment nature and processes are the key to the understanding of the marine ecosystem, and can explain particularly the presence of soft-substrata habitats. For predictions of the occurrence of species and habitats, detailed sedimentological information is required. This paper presents a methodology to create high quality sedimentological data grids of grain-size fractions and the percentage of silt-clay. Based on a multibeam bathymetry terrain model, multiple sources of secondary information (multi-scale terrain variables) were derived. Through the use of the geostatistical technique, Kriging with an external drift (KED), this secondary information was used to assist in the interpolation of the sedimentological data. For comparison purposes, the more commonly used Ordinary Kriging technique was also applied. Validation indices indicated that KED gave better results for all of the maps.},

We solve the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations governing marine flows on a mesh made up of triangles extruded from the surface toward the seabed to obtain prismatic three-dimensional elements. Diffusion is implemented using the symmetric interior penalty method. The tracer equation is consistent with the continuity equation. A Lax–Friedrichs flux is used to take into account internal wave propagation. By way of illustration, a flow exhibiting internal waves in the lee of an isolated seamount on the sphere is simulated. This enables us to show the advantages of using an unstructured mesh, where the resolution is higher in areas where the flow varies rapidly in space, the mesh being coarser far from the region of interest. The solution exhibits the expected wave structure. Linear and quadratic shape functions are used, and the extension to higher-order discretization is straightforward.},

abstract = {Data assimilation is an iterative approach to the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system using both current and past observations of the system together with a model for the system's time evolution. Rather than solving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available, one uses the model to "forecast" the current state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a practical method for data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of "ensemble Kalman filter", in which the state estimate and its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed rather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble Kalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the US National Weather Service. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study details two unique methods to quantify cloud-immersion statistics for tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs). The first technique uses a new algorithm for determining cloud-base height using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) cloud products, and the second method uses numerical atmospheric simulation along with geostationary satellite data. Cloud-immersion statistics are determined using MODIS data for March 2003 over the study region consisting of Costa Rica, southern Nicaragua, and northern Panama. Comparison with known locations of cloud forests in northern Costa Rica shows that the MODIS-derived cloud-immersion maps successfully identify known cloud-forest locations in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) database. Large connected regions of cloud immersion are observed in regions in which the trade wind flow is directly impinging upon the mountain slopes; in areas in which the flow is parallel to the slopes, a fractured spatial distribution of TMCFs is observed. Comparisons of the MODIS-derived cloud-immersion map with the model output show that the MODIS product successfully captures the important cloudimmersion patterns in the Monteverde region of Costa Rica. The areal extent of cloud immersion is at a maximum during morning hours and at a minimum during the afternoon, before increasing again in the evening. Cloud-immersion frequencies generally increase with increasing elevation and tend to be higher on the Caribbean Sea side of the mountains. This study shows that the MODIS data may be used successfully to map the biogeography of cloud forests and to quantify cloud immersion over cloud-forest locations.},

abstract = {An understanding of temporal patterns of migration and spatial connectivity between home ranges and spawning sites is necessary for effective management of species that form transient spawning aggregations. The Nassau Grouper Epinephelus striatus is a Caribbean coral reef fish that displays such spawning aggregations, which have been overfished to the point of threatening the species. Using acoustic telemetry, we examined the size at which Nassau Grouper migrate to spawning aggregations, the timing of migrations, and the distance of migration routes used by Nassau Grouper from within and outside of a large, no-take marine reserve in the central Bahamas. Fish (total n = 19) were tagged in 2004 (n = 6) and 2005 (n = 13) and were tracked for one to four spawning seasons. Fish that were 54 cm TL or greater made spawning migrations, with all but one migrating southward along the shelf edge of Exuma Sound for a distance of 70 km to over 200 km, usually during the December full moon. Fish typically made one migration annually, which lasted from 1 to 3 weeks, with fish remaining at spawning sites for only 1–2 d; however, when the full moon was early in the spawning season, several fish remained away from their home reefs through two lunar cycles or delayed their migrations by a month, and one fish made two migrations. Fish that were migrating for the first time had slower swimming speeds to spawning sites than did experienced fish, but swimming speeds were similar between the two groups during return migrations, suggesting that their migration behavior was learned. Our results demonstrate that spawning migration patterns for this species may be more variable in The Bahamas than at other Caribbean locations. The present findings also have important implications for the management of the species, including increasing the minimum size limit to 54 cm or larger and the use of both marine protected areas and seasonal closures to rebuild the spawning stock.},

abstract = {Understanding the context dependence of ecosystem responses to global changes requires the development of new conceptual frameworks. Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C-nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant-soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models.},

abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) differ from lowland moist forests in structure (low stature, small and tough leaves, low diversity) and functioning (low productivity, low nutrient-cycling rates). To explain these differences, a variety of hypotheses have been proposed, most of which are related directly or indirectly to climate, but none of these provides a satisfactory explanation for all typical TMCF traits. The single climatic factor shared by all TMCF, the frequent occurrence of low cloud, has multiple effects, but not all are well understood. In this paper we describe and analyze the climatic and soil-moisture conditions prevailing in TMCF as reported in the literature. TMCF evapotranspiration is limited by both climatic conditions and canopy conductance. TMCF productivity is low, but our understanding of these forest's carbon balance is incomplete. Leaf photosynthetic capacity is not particularly low, but canopy photosynthesis probably is, due to persistent cloudiness (low radiation) and a low leaf-area index (LAI). We suggest that the low LAI of TMCF is controlled by light climate and by leaf structure and longevity. TMCF productivity is probably further limited by a substantial investment of carbon in the growth and functioning of a relatively large root system, which is itself a consequence of unfavorable soil conditions.},

The sites included two evergreen (EF) and two secondary deciduous (DF) rainforests growing in an Andisol of southern Chile. Samples were collected from the organic layer and from mineral soil at 2-20 cm depth. Total P and phosphorus fractions were highest in evergreen forest soil with the predominance of moderate labile (NaOH-Po) fraction. Olsen P, microbial P, labile P fractions, inorganic P fractions and acid phosphatase were greater in the organic layer than the mineral soil, especially under evergreen forests. Evergreen forest litter affected P cycling enhancing P lability and P-ase activity in soil. Forest management affected P fractions in EF but not in DF forests, and generally did not modify soil properties. Results show that clearing of deciduous forest did not seriously affect the P cycle in this Andisol and confirm the fundamental role of the organic layer in P conservation of these ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The overall size of the ‘‘dead zone'' within the main stem of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries is quantified by the hypoxic volume (HV), the volume of water with dissolved oxygen (DO) less than 2 mg/L. To improve estimates of HV, DO was subsampled from the output of 3-D model hindcasts at times/locations matching the set of 2004–2005 stations monitored by the Chesapeake Bay Program. The resulting station profiles were interpolated to produce bay-wide estimates of HV in a manner consistent with nonsynoptic, cruise-based estimates. Interpolations of the same stations sampled synoptically, as well as multiple other combinations of station profiles, were examined in order to quantify uncertainties associated with interpolating HV from observed profiles. The potential uncertainty in summer HV estimates resulting from profiles being collected over 2 weeks rather than synoptically averaged {\~{}}5km3. This is larger than that due to sampling at discrete stations and interpolating/extrapolating to the entire Chesapeake Bay (2.4 km3). As a result, sampling fewer, selected stations over a shorter time period is likely to reduce uncertainties associated with interpolating HV from observed profiles. A function was derived that when applied to a subset of 13 stations, significantly improved estimates of HV. Finally, multiple metrics for quantifying bay-wide hypoxia were examined, and cumulative hypoxic volume was determined to be particularly useful, as a result of its insensitivity to temporal errors and climate change. A final product of this analysis is a nearly three-decade time series of improved estimates of HV for Chesapeake Bay.},

abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter controlling plant productivity and biogeochemical fluxes between vegetation and the atmosphere. Tropical forests are thought to have comparably high LAIs; however, precise data are scarce and environmental controls of leaf area in tropical forests are not understood. We studied LAI and stand leaf biomass by optical and leaf mass-related approaches in five tropical montane forests along an elevational transect (1,050-3,060 m a.s.l.) in South Ecuador, and conducted a meta-analysis of LAI and leaf biomass data from tropical montane forests around the globe. Study aims were (1) to assess the applicability of indirect and direct approaches of LAI determination in tropical montane forests, (2) to analyze elevation effects on leaf area, leaf mass, SLA, and leaf lifespan, and (3) to assess the possible consequences of leaf area change with elevation for montane forest productivity. Indirect optical methods of LAI determination appeared to be less reliable in the complex canopies than direct leaf mass-related approaches based on litter trapping and a thorough analysis of leaf lifespan. LAI decreased by 40-60{\%} between 1,000 and 3,000 m in the Ecuador transect and also in the pan-tropical data set. This decrease indicates that canopy carbon gain, that is, carbon source strength, decreases with elevation in tropical montane forests. Average SLA decreased from 88 to 61 cm(2) g(-1) whereas leaf lifespan increased from 16 to 25 mo between 1,050 and 3,060 min the Ecuador transect. In contrast, stand leaf biomass was much less influenced by elevation. We conclude that elevation has a large influence not only on the leaf traits of trees but also on the LAI of tropical montane forests with soil N (nitrogen) supply presumably being the main controlling factor.},

abstract = {Predicting metal concentrations in surface waters is an important step in the understanding and ultimately the assessment of the ecological risk associated with metal contamination. In terms of risk an essential piece of information is the accurate knowledge of the partitioning of the metals between the dissolved and particulate phases, as the former species are generally regarded as the most bioavailable and thus harmful form. As a first step towards the understanding and prediction of metal speciation in the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium, the Netherlands), we carried out a detailed analysis of a historical dataset covering the period 1982-2011. This study reports on the results for two selected metals: Cu and Cd. Data analysis revealed that both the total metal concentration and the metal partitioning coefficient (Kd) could be predicted using relatively simple empirical functions of environmental variables such as salinity and suspended particulate matter concentration (SPM). The validity of these functions has been assessed by their application to salinity and SPM fields simulated by the hydro-environmental model SLIM. The high-resolution total and dissolved metal concentrations reconstructed using this approach, compared surprisingly well with an independent set of validation measurements. These first results from the combined mechanistic-empirical model approach suggest that it may be an interesting tool for risk assessment studies, e.g. to help identify conditions associated with elevated (dissolved) metal concentrations. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Both re- mote video techniques recorded greater species richness and relative density of the most common species of Labridae, Ophthalmolepsis lineolatus. Baited remote vi- deo recorded the rarer, large predatory fish species (e.g. Seriola hippos, Glaucosoma hebraicum, Heterodontus portusjacksoni).

abstract = {Our understanding of the recruitment of estuarine fishes has been strongly influenced by two views: first, that estuaries are important nurseries and second, that many species are estuarine dependent. Based on an attempt to review the world-wide literature on these topics, it appears that both of these views have merit but could benefit from additional attention and clarification. The term estuarine dependency is used in a variety of ways depending on the author and context and even how one defines estuary. Further, and perhaps most importantly, we often lack the comparative data on habitat use by fishes in the ocean vs. the estuary to make judgments about dependency. To that end we have analyzed the distribution patterns of fish species along the estuarine-coastal ocean ecotone in southern New Jersey, U.S. to evaluate the fish response. As a result, it appears the degree of estuarine use is quite variable among species, as well as at geographic, annual and cohort-specific scales. Thus, further synthesis is necessary and it might focus on: first, more information on fish use in different types of estuaries across a broad geographical range; second, a better understanding of the functional significance of habitats across the habitat landscapes of the estuary-ocean ecotone; third, any further synthesis needs to incorporate of the role of biotic variables (e.g. predation, competition) in order to enhance our understanding of the degree of estuarine dependency; fourth, we need to determine how freshwater flow into estuaries might influence habitat use especially with regard to the potential role of the offshore estuary. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {During the course of 1996, the brackish to freshwater tidal reaches of the Schelde Estuary were sampled monthly along a longitudinal transect to study the origin and composition of phytoplankton communities in the freshwater tidal estuary. Variation in the phytoplankton community as a whole and its relation with the abiotic environment was analysed using multivariate analysis with variation partitioning. Of the variation in the species data 23.4{\%} was spatially structured and a large part (13.8{\%}) was explained by salinity or factors co-varying with salinity, with a marked species succession observed along the salinity gradient. Spatial variation not related to salinity (9.6{\%}) was mainly situated within the freshwater tidal reaches, where in the uppermost stations phytoplankton was imported from the riverine tributaries while in the more downstream situated stations it was produced in situ. Riverine phytoplankton declined after import into the estuary where it was replaced by autochthonous, estuarine populations which were adapted to the low light climate and/or resistant to rotifer grazing. Of the species variation 27.8{\%} was temporally structured. While riverine blooms appeared to be initiated by an increase in irradiance a decrease in river discharge in spring, estuarine phytoplankton only developed in summer, when temperature increased. Some potentials and limitations of the use of multivariate analyses with variation partitioning in pelagic estuarine environments are discussed in view of our results. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

The main goals of the project were to acquire knowledge with respect to the pollution problems in the Scheldt estuary and to apply this knowledge to management issues of the Scheldt on an operational level. The main interest was to understand quantitatively the relation between inputs of polluting substances and effects on the ecosystem. In the framework of the project, a water quality model for the Scheldt estuary was made. In 1995, the model area was expanded to include the Belgian coastal region at the mouth of the estuary. The model calculates the fate of discharged substances and establishes the relation between pollution inputs and the resulting water quality, including general water quality (oxygen, pH, alkalinity, major ion chemistry and nutrients) as well as pollutant concentrations. The model incorporates all chemical processes which affect these concentrations, including the precipitation/dissolution of metal sulphides which to a large extent controls the fate of trace metals. Based on calibration and verification exercises, it has been shown that the model provides a good representation of the physical and chemical processes taking place within the estuary and can therefore be used to support policy development for the estuary. For example, the model can compute how the water and sediment quality in the estuary will respond to reduced inputs of waste or to such human activities as dredging.},

Our synthesis study of 92 forests in different climate zones revealed that nutrient availability indeed plays a crucial role in determining NEP and ecosystem carbon-use efficiency (CUEe; that is, the ratio of NEP to gross primary production (GPP)). Forests with high GPP exhibited high NEP only in nutrient-rich forests (CUEe = 33 ± 4{\%}; mean ± s.e.m.). In nutrient-poor forests, a much larger proportion of GPP was released through ecosystem respiration, resulting in lower CUEe (6 ± 4{\%}). Our finding that nutrient availability exerts a stronger control on NEP than on carbon input (GPP) conflicts with assumptions of nearly all global coupled carbon cycle–climate models, which assume that carbon inputs through photosynthesis drive biomass production and carbon sequestration. An improved global understanding of nutrient availability would therefore greatly improve carbon cycle modelling and should become a critical focus for future research.},

abstract = {In dynamic coastal systems such as the Chesapeake Bay, limited coverage and frequency of in situ measurements often makes generalizability of regional forecasting systems difficult. Satellite-derived environmental variables have the potential to address this problem, but satellite datasets suffer from incomplete coverage as well: atmospheric conditions-most notably cloud cover-lead to data gaps that significantly hinder the broad application of satellite-informed predictions. In this study, the Chesapeake Bay estuary was used as a model "test bed" to which we applied the power of near real-time satellite-derived observations to the issue of water quality monitoring. To use remote sensing in support of spatially complete estimates of salinity and temperature in the Bay, we tested geospatial interpolation techniques as a method for filling gaps and minimizing errors in the satellite record. These interpolated values were then compared to the output of a regional hydrodynamic model in order to assess the relative value of each method for generating inputs into various modeling applications. Results show that MODIS-derived salinity and temperature can be interpolated with acceptable accuracy in the Bay, with a mean absolute error of 1.88. psu and 0.60. ??C. These errors differed systematically from ChesROMS errors both spatially and seasonally, with higher errors for salinity and lower errors for temperature at most sampling stations throughout the year. This suggests that the two techniques offer complementary information that can be applied to ecological monitoring systems in complex estuaries like Chesapeake Bay. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The addition of P was associated with a marginally significant (P = 0.058) increase in fine-litter production that was consistent across all litter fractions.

abstract = {Live aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important source of uncertainty in the carbon balance from the tropical regions in part due scarcity of reliable estimates of live AGB and its variation across landscapes and forest types. Studies of forest structure and biomass stocks of Neotropical forests are biased toward Amazonian and Central American sites. In particular, standardized estimates of aboveground biomass stocks for the Brazilian Atlantic forest are rarely available. Notwithstanding the role of environmental variables that control the distribution and abundance of biomass in tropical lowland forests has been the subject of considerable research, the effect of short, steep elevational gradients on tropical forest structure and carbon dynamics is not well known. In order to evaluate forest structure and live AGB variation along an elevational gradient (0-1100m a.s.l.) of coastal Atlantic Forest in SE Brazil, we carried out a standard census of woody stems ???4.8cm dbh in 13 1-ha permanent plots established on four different sites in 2006-2007. Live AGB ranged from 166.3Mgha-1 (bootstrapped 95{\%} CI: 144.4,187.0) to 283.2Mgha-1 (bootstrapped 95{\%} CI: 253.0,325.2) and increased with elevation. We found that local-scale topographic variation associated with elevation influences the distribution of trees {\textgreater}50cm dbh and total live AGB. Across all elevations, we found more stems (64-75{\%}) with limited crown illumination but the largest proportion of the live AGB (68-85{\%}) was stored in stems with highly illuminated or fully exposed crowns. Topography, disturbance and associated changes in light and nutrient supply probably control biomass distribution along this short but representative elevational gradient. Our findings also showed that intact Atlantic forest sites stored substantial amounts of carbon aboveground. The live tree AGB of the stands was found to be lower than Central Amazonian forests, but within the range of Neotropical forests, in particular when compared to Central American forests. Our comparative data suggests that differences in live tree AGB among Neotropical forests are probably related to the heterogeneous distribution of large and medium-sized diameter trees within forests and how the live biomass is partitioned among those size classes, in accordance with general trends found by previous studies. In addition, the elevational variation in live AGB stocks suggests a large spatial variability over coastal Atlantic forests in Brazil, clearly indicating that it is important to consider regional differences in biomass stocks for evaluating the role of this threatened tropical biome in the global carbon cycle. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {One-way layouts, i.e., a single factor with several levels and multiple observations at each level, frequently arise in various fields. Usually not only a global hypothesis is of interest but also multiple comparisons between the different treatment levels. In most practical situations, the distribution of observed data is unknown and there may exist a number of atypical measurements and outliers. Hence, use of parametric and semiparametric procedures that impose restrictive distributional assumptions on observed samples becomes questionable. This, in turn, emphasizes the demand on statistical procedures that enable us to accurately and reliably analyze one-way layouts with minimal conditions on available data. Nonparametric methods offer such a possibility and thus become of particular practical importance. In this article, we introduce a new R package nparcomp which provides an easy and user-friendly access to rank-based methods for the analysis of unbalanced one-way layouts. It provides procedures performing multiple comparisons and computing simultaneous confidence intervals for the estimated effects which can be easily visualized. The special case of two samples, the nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem, is included. We illustrate the implemented procedures by examples from biology and medicine.},

abstract = {Secondary forests are a major terrestrial carbon sink and reliable estimates of their carbon stocks are pivotal for understanding the global carbon balance and initiatives to mitigate CO2 emissions through forest management and reforestation. A common method to quantify carbon stocks in forests is the use of allometric regression models to convert forest inventory data to estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). The use of allometric models implies decisions on the selection of extant models or the development of a local model, the predictor variables included in the selected model, and the number of trees and species for destructive biomass measurements. We assess uncertainties associated with these decisions using data from 94 secondary forest plots in central Panama and 244 harvested trees belonging to 26 locally abundant species. AGB estimates from species-specific models were used to assess relative errors of estimates from multispecies models. To reduce uncertainty in the estimation of plot AGB, including wood specific gravity (WSG) in the model was more important than the number of trees used for model fitting. However, decreasing the number of trees increased uncertainty of landscape-level AGB estimates substantially, while including WSG had limited effects on the accuracy of the landscape-level estimates. Predictions of stand and landscape AGB varied strongly among models, making model choice an important source of uncertainty. Local models provided more accurate AGB estimates than foreign models, but high variability in carbon stocks across the landscape implies that developing local models is only justified when landscape sampling is sufficiently intensive. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We provide one of the first comparative evaluations of the ability of a purely spatial SDM, a purely non-spatial SDM and a SDM that combines spatial and environmental information to project species distributions across eight millennia of climate change. Location Eastern North America. Methods To distinguish between the importance of climatic versus spatial explanatory variables we fit three Bayesian SDMs to modern occurrence data for Fagus and Tsuga, two tree genera whose distributions can be reliably inferred from fossil pollen: a spatially varying intercept model, a non-spatial model with climatic variables and a spatially varying intercept plus climate model. Using palaeoclimate data with a high temporal resolution, we hindcasted the SDMs in 1000-year time steps for 8000 years, and compared model projections with palynological data for the same periods. Results For both genera, spatial SDMs provided better fits to the calibration data, more accurate predictions of a hold-out validation dataset of modern trees and higher variance in current predictions and hindcasted projections than non-spatial SDMs. Performance of non-spatial and spatial SDMs according to the area under the receiver operating curve varied by genus. For both genera, false negative rates between non-spatial and spatial models were similar, but spatial models had lower false positive rates than non-spatial models. Main conclusions The inclusion of computationally demanding spatial random effects in SDMs may be warranted when ecological or evolutionary processes prevent taxa from shifting their distributions or when the cost of false positives is high.},

Habitat mapping is a useful tool for ecologists to analyze spatial data. Rocky shore ecosystems comprise a mosaic of habitat types and therefore require good technology to extract fine-scale spatial data on habitat extent and quality. Airborne topographic light detection and ranging data and 0.1-m resolution digital aerial photography were used to map and quantify distinct habitats that influence the distribution of biodiversity on rocky shores. The objectives of this study were to create and test the accuracy of a classification system for the rocky shore habitat, to develop remote sensing techniques useful for the conservation of intertidal rocky shores, and to create detailed digital terrain models for five headlands in the Solitary Island Marine Park, mid-north coast, New South Wales, Australia. The intertidal rocky shore habitats were classified according to tidal heights and substrate type. Ground-truthing of remote sensing data was carried out by visual surveys during low tide. Error assessments using precision analysis and classification accuracy tests confirmed the reliability of the technique with {\textless}5{\%} error. The data generated from this research can be used as a platform for spatial analysis of this environment, including modelling changes in biodiversity under different climate change scenarios.},

The objective of this work was to study elevation changes of woody tissue CO(2) efflux and the relationship to climate variation, site characteristics and growth. Furthermore, we aim to provide insights into important respiration-productivity relationships of a little studied tropical vegetation type. We expected R(S) and R(R) to vary with dry and humid season conditions. We further expected R(S) to vary more than R(R) due to a more stable soil than air temperature regime. Seasonal variation in woody tissue CO(2) efflux was indeed mainly attributable to stems. At the same time, temperature played only a small role in triggering variations in R(S). At stand level, the ratio of C release (g C m(-2) ground area year(-1)) between stems and roots varied from 4:1 at 1,050 m to 1:1 at 3,050 m, indicating the increasing prevalence of root activity at high elevations. The fraction of growth respiration from total respiration varied between 10 (3,050 m) and 14{\%} (1,050 m) for stems and between 5 (1,050 m) and 30{\%} (3,050 m) for roots. Our results show that respiratory activity and hence productivity is not driven by low temperatures towards higher elevations in this tropical montane forest. We suggest that future studies should examine the limitation of carbohydrate supply from leaves as a driver for the changes in respiratory activity with elevation.},

We focus on the understudied altitudinal range between 1500 and 3500 m using micrometeorological data associated with a permanent tree plot network designed to study cloud forest biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics. Data from this plot network were supplemented with data in the public domain across a 20 000 km(2) area with time series at individual sites lasting from 2 to 17 yr. Observed diurnal and seasonal trends in microclimate variables were explained by diurnal and seasonal variation in solar radiation and atmospheric moisture flux. Altitudinal trends in microclimate varied seasonally, with solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature reaching their annual maximum earlier at higher altitudes, likely because of seasonally shifting cloud dynamics. Cloud dynamics were important in determining diurnal, seasonal, and altitudinal trends in several microclimate variables, suggesting that changes to cloud frequency and altitudinal occurrence associated with global climate change could have important impacts on cloud forest ecosystem dynamics, in addition to those of rising temperatures.},

Competing interests in the benefits of forest resources and forest land are omnipresent, and the need for a sound basis for analysis and conflict resolution has never been greater. The process of global forest resources assessment (FRA) has responded to this challenge. By adopting the concept of sustainable forest management as a reporting framework, FRA is now well placed to provide a holistic perspective on global forest resources, their management and uses. Beyond the conventional production and environmental dimensions of forestry, FRA now includes parameters that are important to forest dwellers and rural poor people, such as the value of non-wood forest products and trends in fuelwood removals. By addressing the thematic elements of sustainable forest management, FRA has evolved into an instrument that is indispensible in international negotiations and arrangements related to forests, and for clarifying the relationship of forestry to sustainable development.},

At this stage, the effort is focused mainly on the physical aspects of the modelling as an important background for the future investigation of nutrient dynamics, biogeochemical processes and contaminant transport in Sacca di Goro. The model is forced by considering tidal surface elevation at open sea boundary, river discharges, surface stress as a function of wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity and cloud coverage, bottom roughness and heat flux through sea surface. The numerical model was tested and verified against short observations for water surface elevation and currents during high tide events and also using complete 1 year series of salinity and temperature records. After the calibration phase, surface elevation and current patterns formed under variety of tide and wind forcing have been studied. The travelling times of coming/outgoing Adriatic Sea tides and residence times for the different parts of lagoon have been also calculated. Finally, the differences in temperature and salinity fields calculated before and after an intervention to improve lagoon-Adriatic Sea exchange have been analysed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To test whether cryptogamic plant communities in tropical Andean rain forests are distributed in floristically discrete communities corresponding to altitudinal belts, I subjected the elevational distribution of pteridophytes along two elevational gradients in Bolivia, and of bryophytes and lichens along two transects in Peru and Colombia (data from Gradstein {\&} Frahm, 1987; Wolf, 1993) to an analysis of deviance. All well-defined elevational boundaries in floristic composition were related to marked ecological changes: the transition from the steep mountains to the hilly lowland zone coupled with a change in geological substrate at 400 m along the Bolivian Carrasco transect, a strong humidity gradient at 1000 m at the Bolivian Masicuri transect and at 1250-1980 m along the Colombian transect, and the transition from mixed cloud forests to forests dominated by Polylepis or Podocarpus at 3400-3600 m in Carrasco, at 1650-1800 m in Masicuri, and at 3670 m in Colombia. Consequently, floristic elevational belts appear to be well-defined at strong environmental boundaries and in fairly species-poor forest communities where the presence or absence of one or a few tree species influences the whole ecosystem while they are ill-defined in species-rich communities such as tropical forests at low to mid-elevations.},

abstract = {The current study aims to investigate the processes governing the evolution of major morphological features in alluvial estuaries as well as their morphodynamic interaction with the geometry by means of a 3D morphodynamic, process-based numerical model (Delft3D). The main hypothesis is that channel-shoal patterns evolve through the interaction between tidal movement, the available sediments and the tidal basins' geometry. Once such a system is not disturbed too much by extreme events, stable morphological patterns will emerge that compare well with observed features.Starting from a flat bed and imposing the Western Scheldt geometry, model results show two distinct time-scales, i.e. channel-shoal pattern formation within decades and a slow longitudinal profile development continuing for centuries. The developing channel-shoal patterns reflect major morphological features observed in the Western Scheldt estuary. Using the 1998 bathymetry as a reference, we applied different indicators and techniques to evaluate the model performance over time, namely: visual comparison, hypsometries, Brier Skill Score (BSS), mean basin depth and longitudinal profiles. Sensitivity analysis shows that trends in development are similar for different model parameter settings, like introducing salt-fresh water density differences or variations in sediment grain size and sediment transport formulation. Varying river discharge and including non-erodible layers, dredging and dumping activities and 3D hydrodynamics led to occasional improvements. The geometry is an important governing factor for pattern development. Applying an erodible geometry reveals a timescale for geometric adaptation that is much longer than the pattern development timescale within the basin. Model runs including highly schematized extreme conditions suggest that extreme events play a limited role.The main conclusion of the study is that the interaction between tidal forcing and basin geometry plays a major role in the development of morphological features in an alluvial tidal basin such as the Western Scheldt. A process-based model taking into account these major forcing mechanisms can predict such features with significant skill. The bathymetries generated in this study may form the basis for further studies considering, for example, the impact of sea level rise on estuarine morphodynamic development, or a rapid assessment of estuarine bathymetry in the absence of measured data. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper contains a strategy for estimating total aboveground biomass of tropical forests. We developed regression equations to estimate aboveground biomass of individual trees as a function of diameter at breast height, total height, wood density, and Holdridge life zone (sensu Holdridge 1967). The regressions are applied to some 5,300 trees from 43 independent sample plots, and 101 stand tables from large-scale forest inventories in four countries, to estimate commercial and total aboveground biomass per unit area by forest type, and to estimate expansion factors defined as the ratio of aboveground to commercial biomass. The quadratic stand diameter (QSD, i.e., the diameter of a tree of average basal area) in a given forest stand influences the magnitude of the expansion factor. Stands of small trees have large expansion factors (up to 6.4), and as QSD increases, the expansion factor decreases to a constant value (about 1.75). For undisturbed forests in moist, moist transition to dry, and dry life zones respectively, the expansion factors for total aboveground biomass were 1.74, 1.95, and 1.57 respectively. For undisturbed, logged, and nonproductive forest categories used by the FAO to report global commercial wood volume data, we estimated expansion factors of 1.75, 1.90, and 2.00 respectively. Applying these factors to FAO data results in a 28 to 47{\%} increase in previous volume-derived estimates of tropical forest biomass. However, estimates of tropical forest biomass based on small destructive samples continue to be high relative to estimates based on volume data.},

abstract = {Trees reduce their carbon (C) allocation to roots and mycorrhizal fungi in response to high nitrogen (N) additions, which should reduce the N retention capacity of forests. The time needed for recovery of mycorrhizas after termination of N loading remains unknown. Here, we report the long-term impact of N loading and the recovery of ectomycorrhiza after high N loading on a Pinus sylvestris forest. We analysed the N{\%} and abundance of the stable isotope (15) N in tree needles and soil, soil microbial fatty acid biomarkers and fungal DNA. Needles in N-loaded plots became enriched in (15) N, reflecting decreased N retention by mycorrhizal fungi and isotopic discrimination against (15) N during loss of N. Meanwhile, needles in N-limited (control) plots became depleted in (15) N, reflecting high retention of (15) N by mycorrhizal fungi. N loading was terminated after 20yr. The $\delta$(15) N and N{\%} of the needles decreased 6yr after N loading had been terminated, and approached values in control plots after 15yr. This decrease, and the larger contributions compared with N-loaded plots of a fungal fatty acid biomarker and ectomycorrhizal sequences, suggest recovery of ectomycorrhiza. High N loading rapidly decreased the functional role of ectomycorrhiza in the forest N cycle, but significant recovery occurred within 6-15yr after termination of N loading.},

The research focus is on the dynamics in the two basins and in the multiple straits connecting them and more specifically on how the model replicates the temporal and spatial variability of physical processes. The comparison against observed data indicates the realism in the simulations of the exchange flows. The simulations demonstrated that in contrast to the tidal variability which decreases in the strait, the role of the barotropic forcing due to weather systems increases. In this zone reversal of transport is well manifested by the increased difference between the surface and bottom salinity values. Small sub-basins like Arkona and Bornholm play the role of reservoirs for denser water which under specific conditions cascades on its way to the Gotland Deep. Unlike the intermediate and deep water salinity in the Baltic Sea, which is strongly affected by fluxes in the straits, the simulated winter-refill and evolution of cold intermediate water are rather driven by surface cooling and processes in the upper mixed layer.},

abstract = {Aim Senesced-leaf litter plays an important role in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. While green-leaf nutrients have been reported to be affected by climatic factors at the global scale, the global patterns of senesced-leaf nutrients are not well understood. Location Global. Methods Here, bringing together a global dataset of senesced-leaf N and P spanning 1253 observations and 638 plant species at 365 sites and of associated mean climatic indices, we describe the world-wide trends in senesced-leaf N and P and their stoichiometric ratios. Results Concentration of senesced-leaf N was highest in tropical forests, intermediate in boreal, temperate, and mediterranean forests and grasslands, and lowest in tundra, whereas P concentration was highest in grasslands, lowest in tropical forests and intermediate in other ecosystems. Tropical forests had the highest N : P and C : P ratios in senesced leaves. When all data were pooled, N concentration significantly increased, but senesced-leaf P concentration decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP). The N : P and C : P ratios also increased with MAT and MAP, but C : N ratios decreased. Plant functional type (PFT), i.e. life-form (grass, herb, shrub or tree), phylogeny (angiosperm versus gymnosperm) and leaf habit (deciduous versus evergreen), affected senesced-leaf N, P, N : P, C : N and C : P with a ranking of senesced-leaf N from high to low: forbs approximate to shrubs approximate to trees {\textgreater} grasses, while the ranking of P was forbs approximate to shrubs approximate to trees {\textless} grasses. The climatic trends of senesced-leaf N and P and their stoichiometric ratios were similar between PFTs. Main conclusions Globally, senesced-leaf N and P concentrations differed among ecosystem types, from tropical forest to tundra. Differences were significantly related to global climate variables such as MAT and MAP and also related to plant functional types. These results at the global scale suggest that nutrient feedback to soil through leaf senescence depends on both the climatic conditions and the plant composition of an ecosystem.},

We present both direct and indirect evidence of anthropogenic influences on cloud forest tree line location; these human influences should be incorporated in definitions of Andean tree lines as (1) the extensification of grassland for grazing and potato cultivation for the upper limit, and (2) the intensification of the agricultural frontier, fuelwood gathering, and timber extraction for the lower limit. Although we do not claim to fully debunk the prevalent paradigm of tree line dynamics (which is descriptive, depends on the natural sciences, and sees tree lines as physically controlled), we hope to achieve increased recognition for a challenging alternate view of tropical tree lines as functional, resource-use dependent, and human-driven. Management plans and overall tropical montane cloud forest conservation strategies need to consider this new perspective and incorporate a proactive and assertive approach toward restoration of Andean forests in a way that will encourage landscape diversity in tropical mountain ecoregions.},

abstract = {A detailed study of montane and lowland forest areas at 1710 and 380 m respectively is presented; supporting data from three other lowland forests are also given. 1. The soils under the forests are compared. The montane is appreciably more acid in the A1 horizon, has a lower calcium-status, contains more organic matter, has a coarser texture and has freer drainage. 2. The forests are shown to be very similar in structure. The montane forest is somewhat less dense (Table 2), and the trees are of slightly lesser mean height and diameter (Table 3), but there is not much difference in the extent of the canopy holes. Concerning undergrowth plants (Table 4), the montane plot bore fewer saplings and poles (woody plants 3-9 ft, 9-20 ft) but far more cyclanths and palms. The data from the extra lowland plots indicate that the plot studied in detail was essentially typical of forest over a wide area in eastern Ecuador. 3. The stratification of forests is analysed more closely than by other workers and various types are distinguished. It is concluded that stratification of species has not been shown for any species-rich primary tropical lowland rain forest. Stratification of the heights of individuals and of canopy volume or mass is related to species-paucity and to the regeneration pattern. Other forms of stratification are briefly discussed. The montane forest shows no stratification of individuals or, over the whole plot, of canopy volume. No regular strata of individuals have been located in the four lowland forests (cf. Fig. 4). 4. Various evidence is used to show that all the forests investigated are either primary or very old secondary. 5. The leaf size spectra of the montane and lowland forests are similar but the montane has less macrophylls and more notophylls and microphylls. The montane forest has shorter buttresses, more leaning and distorted boles, and less monopodial crowns. 6. Both forests have strong floristic affinities (at the family level) with the Amazonian hylaea; the montane forest also contains a distinctly Andean element. 7. A revised system of synusiae of epiphytes and climbers is presented, together with a detailed analysis of the numbers of species and individuals in different taxonomic groups and arbitrary height classes in the two forest types. The montane forest has a greater abundance of skiophytic bryophytes, pteridophytes, bromeliads, and orchids and of photophytic bryophytes and macrolichens. The lowland forest has more photophytic dicotyledonous climbers and more climbing and epiphytic Araceae. 8. The classification of tropical rain forests is discussed and the three formation-types recognized by Richards (1952) are renamed Lowland Rain forest, Lower Montane Rain forest and Upper Montane Rain forest. The montane forest studied is assigned to the Lower Montane Rain forest formation-type and the lowland forests to the Lowland Rain forest formation-type. The limitations of a single system of formation-types for the whole of the tropics are emphasized.},

abstract = {Moisture availability has the potential to affect tropical forest productivity at scales ranging from leaf to ecosystem. We compared data for leaf photosynthetic, chemical and structural traits of canopy trees, litterfall production and seasonal availability of soil water at four sites across a precipitation gradient (1,800-3,500 mm year(-1)supercript stop) in lowland Panamanian forest to determine how productivity at leaf and ecosystem scales may be related. We found stronger seasonality in soil water potential at drier sites. Values were close to zero at all sites during the wet season and varied between a minimum of -2.5 MPa and -0.3 MPa at the driest and wettest sites, respectively, during the dry season. Leaf photosynthesis and nitrogen concentration decreased with increasing precipitation, whereas leaf thickness increased with increasing precipitation. Leaf toughness and fiber/N ratios increased with increasing precipitation indicating reduced nutritional content and palatability with precipitation. Seasonality of litter production and quality decreased with increasing precipitation, but the amount of litterfall produced was not substantially different among sites. It appears that in Neotropical forest, moisture availability is associated with leaf photosynthetic and defensive traits that influence litterfall timing and quality. Therefore, variation in leaf physiological traits has the potential to influence decomposition and nutrient cycling through effects on litter quality.},

abstract = {Aquatic habitat suitability models have increasingly received attention due to their wide management applications. Ecological expert knowledge has been frequently incorporated in such models to link environmental conditions to the quantitative habitat suitability of aquatic species. Since the formalisation of problem-specific human expert knowledge is often difficult and tedious, data-driven machine learning techniques may be helpful to extract knowledge from ecological datasets. In this paper, both expert knowledge-based and data-driven fuzzy habitat suitability models were developed and the performance of these models was compared. For the data-driven models, a hill-climbing optimisation algorithm was applied to derive ecological knowledge from the available data. Based on the available ecological expert knowledge and on biological samples from the Zwalm river basin (Belgium), habitat suitability models were generated for the mayfly Baetis rhodani (Pictet 1843). Data-driven models appeared to outperform expert knowledge-based models substantially, while a step-forward model selection procedure indicated that physical habitat variables adequately described the mayfly habitat suitability in the studied area. This study has important implications on the application of expert knowledge in ecological studies, especially if this knowledge is extrapolated to other areas. The results suggest that data-driven models can complement expert knowledge-based approaches and hence improve model reliability. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Atmospheric sulfur deposition above certain limits can represent a threat to tropical forests, causing nutrient imbalances and mobilizing toxic elements that impact biodiversity and forest productivity. Atmospheric sources of sulfur deposited by precipitation have been roughly identified in only a few lowland tropical forests. Even scarcer are studies of this type in tropical mountain forests, many of them mega-diversity hotspots and especially vulnerable to acidic deposition. In these places, the topographic complexity and related streamflow conditions affect the origin, type, and intensity of deposition. Furthermore, in regions with a variety of natural and anthropogenic sulfur sources, like active volcanoes and biomass burning, no source emission data has been used for determining the contribution of each source to the deposition. The main goal of the current study is to evaluate sulfate (SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} deposition by rain and occult precipitation at two topographic locations in a tropical mountain forest of southern Ecuador, and to trace back the deposition to possible emission sources applying back-trajectory modeling. To link upwind natural (volcanic) and anthropogenic (urban/industrial and biomass-burning) sulfur emissions and observed sulfate deposition, we employed state-of-the-art inventory and satellite data, including volcanic passive degassing as well. We conclude that biomass-burning sources generally dominate sulfate deposition at the evaluated sites. Minor sulfate transport occurs during the shifting of the predominant winds to the north and west. Occult precipitation sulfate deposition and likely rain sulfate deposition are mainly linked to biomass-burning emissions from the Amazon lowlands. Volcanic and anthropogenic emissions from the north and west contribute to occult precipitation sulfate deposition at the mountain crest Cerro del Consuelo meteorological station and to rain-deposited sulfate at the upriver mountain pass El Tiro meteorological station.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Simulations of virtual species (i.e. species for which the environment–occupancy relationships are known) are increasingly being used to test the effects of different aspects of modelling and sampling strategy on performance of species distribution models (SDMs). Here we discuss an important step of the simulation process: the translation of simulated probabilities of occurrence into patterns of presence and absence. Often a threshold strategy is used to generate virtual occurrences, where presence always occurs above a specific simulated probability value and never below. This procedure effectively translates any shape of simulated species response into a threshold one and eliminates any stochasticity from the species occupancy pattern. We argue that a probabilistic approach should be preferred instead because the threshold response can be treated as a particular case within this framework. This also allows one to address questions relating to the shape of functional responses and avoids convergence issues with some of the most common SDMs. Furthermore, threshold-based virtual species studies generate over-optimistic performance measures that lack classification error or incorporate error from a mixture of sampling and modelling choices. Incorrect use of a threshold approach can have significant consequences for the practising biogeographer. For example, low model performance may be interpreted as due to sample bias or poor model choice, rather than being related to fundamental biological responses to environmental gradients. We exemplify these shortcomings with a case study where we compare results from threshold and probabilistic simulation approaches.},

Mortality was higher on north slopes, while growth and recruitment rates were not significantly different among positions. Soil pH and effects of recent disturbance by Hurricane Gilbert were positively correlated with growth and recruitment, while slope angle and disturbance effects were the best predictors of mortality. The patterns we found in Jamaica, that growth and recruitment were not higher on ridge crests than slopes, are different than those found by Herwitz and Young in Australia where growth and turnover were greater on a ridge crest. Therefore, it is not possible at present to make simple generalizations about dynamics of ridge crest versus slope forests in the montane tropic},

Southern right whales have been extensively hunted over the last 300 years and although numbers have recovered from near extinction in the early 20(th) century, current populations are fragmented and are estimated at only a small fraction of pre-hunting total. Recent extreme right whale calf mortality events at Pen{\'{i}}nsula Vald{\'{e}}s, which constitutes the largest single population, have raised fresh concern for the future of the species. The WorldView2 satellite has a maximum 50 cm resolution and a water penetrating coastal band in the far-blue part of the spectrum that allows it to see deeper into the water column. Using an image covering 113 km(2), we identified 55 probable whales and 23 other features that are possibly whales, with a further 13 objects that are only detected by the coastal band. Comparison of a number of classification techniques, to automatically detect whale-like objects, showed that a simple thresholding technique of the panchromatic and coastal band delivered the best results. This is the first successful study using satellite imagery to count whales; a pragmatic, transferable method using this rapidly advancing technology that has major implications for future surveys of cetacean populations.},

abstract = {This study presents a global analysis of forest cover and forest protection. An updated Global Forest Map (using MODIS2005) provided a current assessment of forest cover within 20 natural forest types. This map was overlaid onto WWF realms and ecoregions to gain additional biogeographic information on forest distribution. Using the 2008 World Database on Protected Areas, percentage forest cover protection was calculated globally, within forest types, realms and ecoregions, and within selected areas of global conservation importance. At the 10{\%} tree cover threshold, global forest cover was 39 million km2. Of this, 7.7{\%} fell within protected areas under IUCN management categories I-IV. With the inclusion of IUCN categories V and VI, the level of global forest protection increased to 13.5{\%}. Percentage forest protection (IUCN I-IV) varied greatly between realms from 5.5{\%} (Palearctic) to 13.4{\%} (Australasia), and for forest types from 3.2{\%} (temperate freshwater swamp forest) to 28{\%} (temperate broadleaf evergreen forest). Median protection of forest cover in 670 ecoregions (forest above a specified threshold) was 5.9{\%} (IUCN I-IV); at IUCN I-VI, 46{\%} of the ecoregions had less than 10{\%} forest protection. Considering their biodiversity importance, forest protection within global priority areas was insufficient, e.g., median protection of 8.4{\%} in biodiversity hotspots (IUCN I-IV). Results have policy relevance in terms of the target of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), reconfirmed in 2008, to effectively conserve "at least 10{\%} of each of the world's forest types". Regular updates of these analyses would allow progress towards achieving that target to be monitored. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dispersal is fundamental in determining biodiversity responses to rapid climate change, but recently acquired ecological and evolutionary knowledge is seldom accounted for in either predictive methods or conservation planning. We emphasise the accumulating evidence for direct and indirect impacts of climate change on dispersal. Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species' range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation.},

abstract = {Within the framework of ocean general circulation modeling, the present paper describes an efficient way to discretize partial differential equations on curved surfaces by means of the finite element method on triangular meshes. Our approach benefits from the inherent flexibility of the finite element method. The key idea consists in a dialog between a local coordinate system defined for each element in which integration takes place, and a nodal coordinate system in which all local contributions related to a vectorial degree of freedom are assembled. Since each element of the mesh and each degree of freedom are treated in the same way, the so-called pole singularity issue is fully circumvented. Applied to the shallow water equations expressed in primitive variables, this new approach has been validated against the standard test set defined by [Williamson, D.L., Drake, J.B., Hack, J.J., Jakob, R., Swarztrauber, P.N., 1992. A standard test set for numerical approximations to the shallow water equations in spherical geometry. Journal of Computational Physics 102, 211-224]. Optimal rates of convergence for the P1NC - P1 finite element pair are obtained, for both global and local quantities of interest. Finally, the approach can be extended to three-dimensional thin-layer flows in a straightforward manner. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Crase2012,
abstract = {Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a widely used tool and has many applications in ecology and conservation biology. Spatial autocorrelation (SAC), a pattern in which observations are related to one another by their geographic distance, is common in georeferenced ecological data. SAC in the residuals of SDMs violates the ‘independent errors' assumption required to justify the use of statistical models in modelling species' distributions. The autologistic modelling approach accounts for SAC by including an additional term (the autocovariate) representing the similarity between the value of the response variable at a location and neighbouring locations. However, autologistic models have been found to introduce bias in the estimation of parameters describing the influence of explanatory variables on habitat occupancy. To address this problem we developed an extension to the autologistic approach by calculating the autocovariate on SAC in residuals (the RAC approach). Performance of the new approach was tested on simulated data with a known spatial structure and on strongly autocorrelated mangrove species' distribution data collected in northern Australia. The RAC approach was implemented as generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models. We found that the BRT models with only environmental explanatory variables can account for some SAC, but applying the standard autologistic or RAC approaches further reduced SAC in model residuals and substantially improved model predictive performance. The RAC approach showed stronger inferential performance than the standard autologistic approach, as parameter estimates were more accurate and statistically significant variables were accurately identified. The new RAC approach presented here has the potential to account for spatial autocorrelation while maintaining strong predictive and inferential performance, and can be implemented across a range of modelling approaches.},

abstract = {Spatial distributions of depth-averaged water velocity, shear velocity, and apparent bed load velocity are mapped for the first time in a long reach of a wandering gravel bed river, lower Fraser River, British Columbia. Spatially intensive acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) measurements were collected on the falling limbs of two freshets. Flow in the first year was near the threshold of motion, whereas in the second year discharge exceeded bankfull. Spatial distributions are interpolated from the point data using kriging. Joint density functions for shear velocity and flow depth throughout the reach are presented; marginal densities for shear velocity were near normally distributed but depth distributions were positively skewed by deep pools. The uncertainty of the spatial distributions is also assessed based on modeled temporal variability of the flow and bed load transport, measured aDcp error velocities, and calculated interpolation errors. The resulting maps are remarkably coherent, with maximum depth-averaged velocity, shear velocity, and apparent bed load velocity following the thalweg. Largest values occur in channel bends at zones of flow convergence where the thalweg flow accelerates toward the bank. However, in the lower flow year the highest apparent bed load velocity was observed outside the thalweg in a deep pool downstream of a rapidly eroding cut bank. Erosion at this site was related to a flow confluence with relatively low shear but highly turbulent, strongly three-dimensional separated flow.},

abstract = {Mangrove forests occur along ocean coastlines throughout the tropics, and support numerous ecosystem services, including fisheries production and nutrient cycling. However, the areal extent of mangrove forests has declined by 30–50{\%} over the past half century as a result of coastal development, aqua- culture expansion and over-harvesting1–4. Carbon emissions resulting from mangrove loss are uncertain, owing in part to a lack of broad-scale data on the amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems, particularly below ground5. Here, we quantified whole-ecosystem carbon storage by measuring tree and dead wood biomass, soil carbon content, and soil depth in 25 mangrove forests across a broad area of the Indo-Pacific region—spanning 30◦ of latitude and 73◦ of longitude—where mangrove area and diversity are greatest4,6. These data indi- cate that mangroves are among the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics, containing on average 1,023Mg carbon per hectare. Organic-rich soils ranged from 0.5mto more than 3m in depth and accounted for 49–98{\%} of carbon storage in these systems. Combining our data with other published information, we estimate that mangrove deforestation generates emissions of 0.02–0.12Pg carbon per year—as much as around 10{\%} of emissions from deforestation globally, despite accounting for just 0.7{\%}of tropical forest area.},

Current empirical global NPP-climate relationships predict that the response of NPP to climate diminishes at higher levels of mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT), but data have been relatively scarce in warm and wet tropical ecosystems. By integrating data from a new comprehensive global survey of NPP from tropical forests and a climate gradient from Maui, Hawaii, along with data previously used to develop NPP-climate relationships, I show that there is a strong negative relationship between MAP and NPP in humid ecosystems. The relationships derived here clearly demonstrate that NPP in wet tropical forests is sensitive to climate, and that future forest growth may be limited by increased precipitation forecast by global climate models for the wet tropics.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of tropical forests to the global carbon cycle, ecological controls over landscape-level variation in live aboveground carbon density (ACD) in tropi- cal forests are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a spa- tially comprehensive analysis of ACD variation for a conti- nental tropical forest – Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI) – and tested site factors that may control such variation. We mapped ACD over 1256 ha of BCI using airborne Light De- tection and Ranging (LiDAR), which was well-correlated with ground-based measurements of ACD in Panamanian forests of various ages (r2 = 0.84, RMSE = 17MgCha−1, P {\textless}0.0001). We used multiple regression to examine con- trols over LiDAR-derived ACD, including slope angle, for- est age, bedrock, and soil texture. Collectively, these vari- ables explained 14{\%}of the variation in ACD at 30-m resolu- tion, and explained 33{\%} at 100-m resolution. At all resolu- tions, slope (linked to underlying bedrock variation) was the strongest driving factor; standing carbon stocks were gener- ally higher on steeper slopes. This result suggests that phys- iography may be more important in controlling ACD varia- tion in Neotropical forests than currently thought. Although BCI has been largely undisturbed by humans for a century, past land-use over approximately half of the island still in- fluences ACD variation, with younger forests (80–130 years old) averaging ∼15{\%} less carbon storage than old-growth forests ({\textgreater}400 years old). If other regions of relatively old tropical secondary forests also store less carbon aboveground than primary forests, the effects on the global carbon cycle could be substantial and difficult to detect with traditional satellite monitoring.},

abstract = {1. The recently developed Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) has advantages over traditional methods because it quantifies the utilization distribution of an animal based on its movement path rather than individual points and accounts for temporal autocorrelation and high data volumes. However, the BBMM assumes unrealistic homogeneous movement behaviour across all data. 2. Accurate quantification of the utilization distribution is important for identifying the way animals use the landscape. 3. We improve the BBMM by allowing for changes in behaviour, using likelihood statistics to determine change points along the animal's movement path. 4. This novel extension, outperforms the current BBMM as indicated by simulations and examples of a territorial mammal and a migratory bird. The unique ability of our model to work with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially imfile:///C:/Users/stijn/Desktop/Univ/DOC/Artikels/Bart{\_}et{\_}al-2012-Journal{\_}of{\_}Animal{\_}Ecology.pdfportant for GPS tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules. Moreover, our model extension provides a useful one-dimensional measure of behavioural change along animal tracks. 5. This new method provides a more accurate utilization distribution that better describes the space use of realistic, behaviourally heterogeneous tracks.},

abstract = {Ecosystem nutrient use efficiency-the ratio of net primary productivity to soil nutrient supply-is an integrative measure of ecosystem functioning. High productivity and nutrient retention in natural systems are frequently attributed to high species diversity, even though some single-species systems can be highly productive and effective at resource capture. We investigated the effects of both individual species and life-form diversity on ecosystem nutrient use efficiency using model tropical ecosystems comprised of monocultures of three tree species and polycultures in which each of the tree species was coplanted with species of two additional life forms. Tree species significantly influenced nutrient use efficiency by whole ecosystems in monocultures; however, in polycultures, the additional life forms interacted with the influence exerted by the dominant tree. Furthermore, the presence of the additional life forms significantly increased nutrient uptake and uptake efficiency, but in only two of the three systems and 2 of the 4 years of the study period. These results indicate that the effect of life-form diversity on ecosystem functioning is not constant and that there may be temporal shifts in the influence exerted by different components of the community. Furthermore, although species (and life forms) exerted considerable influence on ecosystem nutrient use efficiency, this efficiency was most closely related to soil nutrient availability. These findings demonstrate that ecosystem nutrient use efficiency is an outcome not only of the characteristics of the species or tife forms that comprise the system but also of factors that affect soil nutrient supply. The results argue against the simple upward scaling of nutrient use efficiency from leaves and plants to ecosystems.},

In the present study, the amounts of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, pottasium, calcium and magnesium in root biomass were determined by soil coring and nutrient analysis in forests at three altitudes (1900, 2400 and 3000 m ) in the Ecuadorian Andes. Root biomass increased markedly from 2.8 kg m-2 at 1900 m and 4.0 kg m-2 at 2400 to 6.8 kg m-2 at 3000 m. The contribution of coarse roots ({\textgreater} 2 mm in diameter) to total root biomass increased from about 70{\%} at 1900 m to about 80{\%} at higher altitudes. In fine roots (≤ 2 mm in diameter), concentrations of nutrient except calcium markedly decreased with altitude. Therefore, the nutrient stockes in fine roots were similar at 1900 m and 3000 m for nitrogen and sulphur, and were even lower at higher altitudes for phosphorus, potassium and magnesium. In coarse roots of Graffenrieda emarginata concentrations of nutrient were substantially lower than in fine roots, and were little affected by altitude. The data suggest that the importance of coarse roots for long-term carbon and nutrient accumulation in total plant biomass increases with increasing altitude.},

abstract = {Nitrogen retention and recycling are topics of enduring interest in ecosystem ecology, yet we lack a mechanistic field-tested model of how these processes work in unpolluted, old-growth temperate forests. Forests of the Cordillera Piuchue Ecosystem Study (CPES) in southern Chile provide an opportunity to examine nitrogen cycling and retention in a forest that is virtually free of human disturbance. We applied N-15 pool dilution and pulse-chase tracer techniques as complementary approaches within small plots to understand flows of inorganic nitrogen in the surface soil of an evergreen mixed-angio sperm forest. We also followed separate pulses of (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 for two years to gain insights into how short-term mechanisms of inorganic nitrogen cycling translate into long-term patterns of ecosystem nitrogen retention.Strong consumption appears to limit losses of NH4+ and NO3- from this forest, and predominantly by the same mechanisms for both forms of nitrogen. As a result, the extent of (NH4-)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 retention were also similar, yet similar to 44-fold higher rates of gross NH4+ production leads to the dominance of NH4+ over NO3- in soil and stream waters. Microbial biomass played a key role in the short-term assimilation of N-15 tracers, but retention was only transient. Turnover of N-15 through microbial biomass was rapid and appeared to be only weakly retained in soil exchangeable pools, fine roots, and soil organic matter, resulting in substantial losses of N-15 from soils within weeks of tracer additions. Assimilation of N-15 into fine roots was a much larger sink (13{\%}) than has been reported for other forested ecosystems (1-3{\%}), and the transport of N-15 from microbial biomass to aboveground sinks in vegetation may explain the observed loss of N-15 from surface soils over time. Losses of N-15 from microbial biomass did not enter the extractable pool of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), suggesting that DON losses do not originate directly from active microbial turnover, and also that microbial activity may not exert as much control over hydrologic losses of DON as compared to losses of NH4+ and NO3- Our results also suggest an additional rapid and extremely transient (1 d) mechanism of NO3- retention via incorporation into extractable-DON.The long-term retention of N-15 at the whole-plot level did not differ significantly between (NH4-)-N-15 and 15NO3- treatments, and averaged 65{\%} after two years. The lack of an appreciable change in 15N recovery for similar to1.5 yr following the initial assimilation, redistribution, and loss of N-15 suggests that the majority of N-15 was not recycled over the long term through inorganic. nitrogen pools and microbial biomass via mineralization/immobilization pathways. Instead, long-term retention of inorganic N-15 appeared to be dominated by rapid and possibly direct assimilation into a slow-turnover pool of soil organic matter. Elevated N-15 contents in fine-root and microbial pools for up to two years after N-15 additions, however, also indicated sustained biotic retention of inorganic nitrogen. Our results suggest very similar retention of NH4+ and NO3- that is dominated by rapid assimilation and turnover through microbial biomass in the short term (weeks), and transfer from microbial biomass into nitrogen-conserving plant (and to a lesser extent soil organic matter) pools in the long term (years). These processes result in efficient long-term retention of nitrogen in unpolluted old-growth temperate forests.},

abstract = {Equations are developed for the tidally-averaged, width-averaged estuarine salinity and circulation in a rectangular estuary. Width and depth may vary along the length of the channel, as may coefficients of vertical turbulent mixing and along channel diffusion. The system is reduced to a single first-order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation governing the section-averaged salinity. A technique for specifying the ocean boundary condition is given, and solutions are found by numerical integration. Under different assumptions for the diffusion it is possible to reproduce the few existing analytical solutions, in particular the Hansen and Rattray (1965) Central Regime solution, and Chatwin's (1976) solution. The mathematical framework allows easy comparison of the results of different channel geometries and mixing coefficients. Of particular interest is the along-channel distribution of the diffusive fraction of up-estuary salt flux. It is shown that the Hansen and Rattray solution is always diffusion-dominated near the mouth. A theory is presented for estimating the diffusion coefficient within a tidal excursion of the mouth. It is shown that the resulting rapid along-channel increase of diffusion may explain some observed patterns of salinity structure: a decrease in both stratification and along-channel salinity gradient near the mouth. The theory is applied to the Delaware Estuary and Northern San Francisco Bay, and shows reasonable agreement with observed sensitivities of salt intrusion distance to river flow.},

abstract = {An overview of electronic tags that can be used in fish research is given, including radio and acoustic transmitters, data storage tags (DST, also termed archival tags), pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) and passive integrated transponder tags (PIT-tag). Fish telemetry is a term used to describe the application of these methods. Typically, an electronic tag is attached to a free-swimming fish, and information on position, movements and/or measurements of environmental and physiological parameters can be recorded wirelessly by use of a mobile receiver or stationary loggers. For most methods, the fish need not to be recaptured to achieve data. However, DSTs record and store information on environmental and/or physiological parameters in the tag, and therefore need to be retrieved for downloading data. In the case of PSATs, stored data is transferred to satellites when the tag loosens from the fish and pops up to the surface, and in addition, the pop up position is recorded. The developments of telemetry methods have provided opportunities to reveal previously unknown information on fish behavior, habitat use and migrations in fresh water, estuaries, near-coastal areas and oceans, especially since extensive long- term data can be collected repeatedly from individual fish. Detailed information on fish behaviour and migrations is needed to better understand, protect and manage fishes in freshwater and marine systems. The development of successful management measures depends on knowledge of where fish reside and migrate during the day, season and year. There has been a tremendous increase in the use of electronic tagging methods, especially during the last 10-20 years. In addition to descriptive and ecological studies, the methods have been used to assess effects of for instance hydropower production, other river regulations, migration barriers, protected areas, fishing regulations, catch-and-release angling, hatchery-rearing, fish aggregating devices (FADs), water pollution and aquaculture. The main methods for attaching electronic tags to fish are 1) surgical implantation in the body cavity, 2) external attachment, and 3) gastric insertion via the mouth. Potential negative handling effects are inflammations, infections, tag expulsion, altered behavior, decreased swimming performance, reduced feeding, reduced growth and increased mortality. The catch, handling and tagging procedures should have minimal effects on the fish. If not, an anomalous behaviour caused by the tagging may be recorded instead of the natural behaviour, and the study is a failure from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, optimal anaesthetic and tagging methods are required to meet the ethical standards for use of experimental animals, and to ensure fish survival and welfare.},

abstract = {The allocation and cycling of carbon (C) within forests is an important component of the biospheric C cycle, but is particularly understudied within tropical forests. We synthesise reported and unpublished results from three lowland rainforest sites in Amazonia (in the regions of Manaus, Tapajo's and Caxiuana{\~{}}), all major sites of the Large-Scale Biosphere- Atmosphere Programme (LBA). We attempt a comprehensive synthesis of the C stocks, nutrient status and, particularly, the allocation and internal C dynamics of all three sites. The calculated net primary productivities (NPP) are 10.1 1.4MgCha1 yr1 (Manaus), 14.4 1.3MgCha1 yr1 (Tapajo's) and 10.0 1.2MgCha1 yr1 (Caxiuana{\~{}}). All errors bars report standard errors. Soil and leaf nutrient analyses indicate that Tapajo's has significantly more plant-available phosphorus and calcium. Autotrophic respiration at all three sites (14.9-21.4MgCha yr1) is more challenging to measure, with the largest component and greatest source of uncertainty being leaf dark respiration. Comparison of measured soil respiration with that predicted from C cycling measurements provides an independent constraint. It shows general good agreement at all three sites, with perhaps some evidence for measured soil respiration being less than expected. Twenty to thirty percent of fixed C is allocated belowground. Comparison of gross primary productivity (GPP), derived from ecosystem flux measurements with that derived from component studies (NPP plus autotrophic respiration) provides an additional crosscheck. The two approaches are in good agreement, giving increased confidence in both approaches to estimating GPP. The ecosystem carbon-use efficiency (CUEs), the ratio of NPP to GPP, is similar at Manaus (0.34 0.10) and Caxiuana{\~{}} (0.32 0.07), butmay be higher at Tapajo's (0.49 0.16), although the difference is not significant. Old growth or infertile tropical forests may have low CUE compared with recently disturbed and/or fertile forests},

abstract = {We present a flux-limiting wetting-drying approach for finite-element discretizations of the shallow-water equations using discontinuous linear elements for the elevation. The key ingredient of the method is the use of limiters for generalized nodal fluxes. This method is implemented into the Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model (SLIM), and is verified against standard test cases. The method is further applied to the wetting and drying of sand banks in the Scheldt Estuary, which is located in northern Belgium and the southern Netherlands. The results obtained for both the benchmarks and the realistic problem illustrate the accuracy of the method in describing the hydrodynamics in the vicinity of dry areas. In particular, the method strictly conserves mass, and there is no transport through dry areas. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Temporal differences in soil ??14C profiles indicate that inputs of recently living organic matter (OM) occur primarily in the upper 20-30 cm but suggest that OM inputs can occur below the primary rooting zone. A three-pool SOM model with downward transport captures most observed variation in ??14C, percentages of C and N, ??13C, and ??15N, supporting the commonly accepted concept of three distinct SOM pools. The model suggests that the importance of the decadal SOM pool in N dynamics is greatest in young and old soils. Altered hydrology and possibly low pH and/or P dynamics in highly developed old soils cause changes in soil C and N turnover and transport of importance for soil biogeochemistry models.},

abstract = {Residence times and exposure times are computed for 13 boxes in the Scheldt Estuary, using the high-resolution tracer-transport model SLIM. The concepts are clearly defined and related to how they should be computed. First, the timescale values are compared with results published previously that were obtained with a simple box model, and an unexpected difference is revealed. This may suggest that a high-resolution model is necessary, even for the computation of such integrated quantities as residence or exposure times. Secondly, the newly computed residence times are compared to the exposures times to illustrate their intrinsic differences. From this difference, it is possible to propose a return coefficient, expressing the fraction of the exposure time that is due to "returning water", i.e. water which has already left the estuary at least once. Finally, the estuarine exposure times are decomposed into the different box exposure times, resulting in a connectivity matrix. This matrix expresses how much time is spent in each of the estuarine subdomains during the water parcels' journey through the estuary. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {External tagging of fish with electronic tags has been used for decades for a wide range of marine and freshwater species. In the early years of fish telemetry research, it was the most commonly used attachment method, but later internal implants became preferred. Recently, the number of telemetry studies using external tagging has increased, especially with the development of archival tags (data storage tags, DSTs), pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and other environment-sensing tags. Scientific evaluations of the tagging method are rather scarce for most species. We identified 89 publications, reporting effects of external tagging for 80 different fish species, which constitute the main basis for this review. External attachment holds certain benefits compared to other tagging methods, for example, speed of application, and it may be the only option for fishes with a body shape unsuitable for surgical implantation, or when using tags with sensors recording the external environment. The most commonly reported problems with external tags are tissue damage, premature tag loss, and decreased swimming capacity, but the effects are highly context dependent and species specific. Reduced growth and survival have also been recorded, but direct mortality caused by external tagging seems rare. Most of the studies reviewed evaluate tag retention, survival, and tissue reac-tions. There is a general need for more research on the effects of external tagging of fish with electronic tags, but par-ticularly there are few studies on predation risk, social interactions, and studies distinguishing capture and handling effects from tagging effects. For PSATs, especially those that are large relative to fish size, there are particular problems with a high proportion of premature tag losses, reduced swimming capacity, and likely increased predation, but there remains a paucity of tag effect studies related to the use of PSATs. Before embarking on a field study employing external tagging with electronic tags, we recommend the use of appropriate pilot studies, controlled where possible, to quantify potential impacts of tagging.},

abstract = {Variation in dispersal and movement patterns of coral reef fishes is likely linked to changes in environmental conditions. Monitoring in situ environmental parameters on coral reefs in conjunction with the movements of fishes can help explain the relationship between exploited populations and their environment. Sixty adult Lethrinus miniatus were acoustically tagged and monitored along a coral reef slope for up to 1 yr. Individuals occurred more often on the reef slope during days of cooler temperatures, suggesting a thermal tolerance threshold may exist. Results indicate that individuals responded to elevated temperatures by moving away from the reef slope to deeper adjacent habitats, thus shifting their position in the water column to remain at a preferred temperature. Space use within the water column (vertical activity space) was not influenced by environmental parameters or fish size, but this result was possibly influenced by use of deeper habitat outside the acoustic array that was not monitored. With elevation of ocean temperature, L. miniatus may need to adapt to warmer waters or disperse into cooler habitats, by either shifting their distribution deeper or towards higher latitudes. Identifying key environmental drivers that affect the distribution of reef fishes is important, and may allow managers to predict the effect of these changes on exploited species.},

abstract = {Aim To test the extent to which the vertical structure of tropical forests is deter-mined by environment, forest structure or biogeographical history. Location Pan-tropical. Methods Using height and diameter data from 20,497 trees in 112 non-contiguous plots, asymptotic maximum height (HAM) and height–diameter rela-tionships were computed with nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) models to: (1) test for environmental and structural causes of differences among plots, and (2) test if there were continental differences once environment and structure were accounted for; persistence of differences may imply the importance of biogeography for ver-tical forest structure. NLME analyses for floristic subsets of data (only/excluding Fabaceae and only/excluding Dipterocarpaceae individuals) were used to examine whether family-level patterns revealed biogeographical explanations of cross-continental differences. Results HAM and allometry were significantly different amongst continents. HAM was greatest in Asian forests (58.3 Ϯ 7.5 m, 95{\%} CI), followed by forests in Africa (45.1 Ϯ 2.6 m), America (35.8 Ϯ 6.0 m) and Australia (35.0 Ϯ 7.4 m), and height– diameter relationships varied similarly; for a given diameter, stems were tallest in Asia, followed by Africa, America and Australia. Precipitation seasonality, basal area, stem density, solar radiation and wood density each explained some variation in allometry and HAM yet continental differences persisted even after these were accounted for. Analyses using floristic subsets showed that significant continental differences in HAM and allometry persisted in all cases. Main conclusions Tree allometry and maximum height are altered by environ-mental conditions, forest structure and wood density. Yet, even after accounting for these, tropical forest architecture varies significantly from continent to continent. The greater stature of tropical forests in Asia is not directly determined by the dominance of the family Dipterocarpaceae, as on average non-dipterocarps are equally tall. We hypothesise that dominant large-statured families create conditions in which only tall species can compete, thus perpetuating a forest dominated by tall individuals from diverse families.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although habitat use reflects a dynamic process, most studies assess habitat use statically as if an animal's successively recorded locations reflected a point rather than a movement process. By relying on the activity time between successive locations instead of the local density of individual locations, movement-based methods can substantially improve the biological relevance of utilization distribution (UD) estimates (i.e. the relative frequencies with which an animal uses the various areas of its home range, HR). One such method rests on Brownian bridges (BBs). Its theoretical foundation (purely and constantly diffusive movements) is paradoxically inconsistent with both HR settlement and habitat selection. An alternative involves movement-based kernel density estimation (MKDE) through location interpolation, which may be applied to various movement behaviours but lacks a sound theoretical basis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: I introduce the concept of a biased random (advective-diffusive) bridge (BRB) and show that the MKDE method is a practical means to estimate UDs based on simplified (isotropically diffusive) BRBs. The equation governing BRBs is constrained by the maximum delay between successive relocations warranting constant within-bridge advection (allowed to vary between bridges) but remains otherwise similar to the BB equation. Despite its theoretical inconsistencies, the BB method can therefore be applied to animals that regularly reorientate within their HRs and adapt their movements to the habitats crossed, provided that they were relocated with a high enough frequency.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Biased random walks can approximate various movement types at short times from a given relocation. Their simplified form constitutes an effective trade-off between too simple, unrealistic movement models, such as Brownian motion, and more sophisticated and realistic ones, such as biased correlated random walks (BCRWs), which are too complex to yield functional bridges. Relying on simplified BRBs proves to be the most reliable and easily usable way to estimate UDs from serially correlated relocations and raw activity information.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic simulation of estuaries requires a single digital elevation model (DEM) resulting from merging of both topographic and bathymetric data. These two datasets are usually produced using different technologies, co-ordinate systems and datums. Intertidal data in particular are often lacking due to the difficulty of data acquisition using conventional survey techniques. This paper presents a fast, accurate and low-cost methodology to fill this gap and highlights the effect of the digital elevation model characteristics, such as the interpolation method and spatial resolution, on modelled water levels and flooded areas. The Lima river estuary, located in North-western Portugal, is used as a case study. Validation tests for commonly available spatial interpolators showed ordinary kriging to be the most adequate interpolator. Digital elevation models with regular grids of 5. m and 50. m resolution were used, together with the original (not interpolated) elevation dataset, as input to a finite element hydrodynamic model for astronomic tide simulation. Results indicate that the larger differences between using different elevation models occur at low tide during spring tide, marginally impacting the flood modelling. The effect of a vertical offset of the chart datum with respect to a part of the digital elevation model was finally investigated, showing a limited influence in the determination of the water levels. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling is one of the most effective habitat analysis methods for wildlife conservation. We evaluated the sensitivity of species distribution modeling to different grain sizes and extent sizes from 30m to 4950m using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling. The grain size represents a unit for analysis, whereas the extent size defines the scope of the analysis in a way that reflects the environmental data for the area in which the species of interest occurs. We compared the resulting suitability indexes and habitat areas based on two approaches. The first approach increases the extent size for a fixed grain size. The second approach increases the grain size and the extent size by equal amounts. The suitability index based on the first approach (R2=0.34) was greater than the suitability index based on the second approach (R2=0.89). The first approach was fitted to a logarithmic function with a critical point at approximately 0.5km, converging to about 0.76. In contrast, the second approach showed a linear decrease to values less than 0.5. The distribution of habitat area found with the second method (R2=0.87) was broader than that found with the first method (R2=0.63). The relationship between the extent size and the landscape index of the first method can be displayed as a power-law graph with a critical point of 0.5km. The method of expanding extent size has greater accuracy, although the time that it requires for data processing is long. The results of this study suggest that the maximum grain size should be approximately 1.5km. If the grain size is greater than 1.5km, the accuracy of the habitat suitability index decreases below 0.6, and the predicted habitat suitability increases dramatically. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The tidally varying circulation, stratification, and salt flux mechanisms are investigated in a shallow salt wedge estuary where fluvial and tidal velocities are large and the steady baroclinic circulation is comparatively weak. The study integrates field observations and numerical simulations of the Merrimack River estuary. At moderate to high discharge the estuary is short and highly stratified, while at lower discharges it shifts to a longer, more weakly stratified estuary; the transition occurs when the length of the salinity intrusion is similar to the tidal excursion. The Merrimack is highly variable at tidal time scales owing to the advection and mixing of a bottom salinity front. Salt flux is predominantly due to tidal processes rather than steady baroclinic or bathymetric shear. Tidal pumping is important near the mouth, but inside the estuary salt flux is due to tidal asymmetries in the elevation and thickness of the halocline that depend on the tidal amplitude and river discharge. Conditions in the Merrimack, including the salinity intrusion length and stratification, vary more with event to seasonal shifts in river discharge than with spring-neap changes in tidal amplitude. An unstructured grid hydrodynamic model is used to simulate conditions in the Merrimack and model results are compared quantitatively against field observations. The model achieves a high skill against time series of water level, salinity, and velocity and captures the spatial structures of salinity, velocity, and salt flux observed in along- and across-estuary transects. High model skills depend on accurate and well-resolved grid bathymetry and low background vertical and horizontal diffusivities.},

An experiment was conducted using tef on Chromic Cambisols for two rainy cropping seasons (2008-2009) in northern Ethiopia. The objective was to assess the short-term effects of tillage frequencies on selected soil properties under continuous tef cropping system. The layout of the experiment was randomized complete block design using three tillage treatments, namely, conventional plowing (T1), four times plowing (T2), and reduced plowing (T3). A statistically significant (P???0.05) effect of tillage treatments on soil moisture (SM) was determined during the experimental periods. SM was higher in T2 in both years followed by T3 in 2009. Soil physical properties (bulk density, BD; total porosity, TP; soil structural stability index, SSI) and soil nutrients (total nitrogen, TN; organic carbon, OC; cation exchange capacity, CEC; potassium, K) were significantly deteriorated by the application of T1 for consecutive two-years. The Paired-Samples T-Test showed significant improvements in these soil parameters due to T2 and T3 in 2009 as compared to the corresponded values in 2008. For example, there were significant increments in SM (11{\%}), TP (18{\%}), SSI (12{\%}), TN (1.2 times), phosphorous (5{\%}), OC (13{\%}), and CEC (15{\%}); but significantly decreased in OC: TN (48{\%}) and BD (4{\%}). Generally, despite the non-significant differences between the effects of T2 and T3, higher TP, SSI, OC, CEC; and lower BD were observed by T3 in 2009. Based on such short-term results of T3 it is possible to forecast its significant long-term effects on soil properties. Thus, for sustainable use of soil systems in the long-term due attention should be given to practice T3 as soil and water management practice in the study area conditions.},

abstract = {Few data are available describing the photosynthetic parameters of the leaves of tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF). Here, we present a study of photosynthetic leaf traits (V(cmax) and J(max)), foliar dark respiration (R(d)), foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and leaf mass per area (LMA) throughout the canopy for five different TMCF species at 3025 m a.s.l. in Andean Peru. All leaf traits showed a significant relationship with canopy height when expressed on an area basis, and V(cmax-area) and J(max-area) almost halved when descending through the TMCF canopy. When corrected to a common temperature, average V(cmax) and J(max) on a leaf area basis were similar to lowland tropical values, but lower when expressed on a mass basis, because of the higher TMCF LMA values. By contrast, R(d) on an area basis was higher than found in tropical lowland forests at a common temperature, and similar to lowland forests on a mass basis. The TMCF J(max)-V(cmax) relationship was steeper than in other tropical biomes, and we propose that this can be explained by either the light conditions or the relatively low VPD in the studied TMCF. Furthermore, V(cmax) had a significant-though relatively weak and shallow-relationship with N on an area basis, but not with P, which is consistent with the general hypothesis that TMCFs are N rather than P limited. Finally, the observed V(cmax)-N relationship (i.e., maximum photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency) was distinctly different from those in tropical and temperate regions, probably because the TMCF leaves compensate for reduced Rubisco activity in cool environments.},

Such scheme is based on a hybrid-type formulation, here named as element-based finite volume method that combines the flexibility of the FEM to deal with unstructured grids, while preserving the local and global fluid-flow conservation aspect of the FVM throughout the discretized domain. The accuracy and robustness of the method are successfully tested using several benchmark cases proposed in the recent literature. Simulations of fully or partially textured sliding bearings are finally employed to show the advantages of being able to adopt irregular meshes both in terms of flexibility for the discretization of complex surface features and computational speed.},

abstract = {Aim Species distribution modelling is commonly used to guide future conservation policies in the light of potential climate change. However, arbitrary decisions during the model-building process can affect predictions and contribute to uncertainty about where suitable climate space will exist. For many species, the key climatic factors limiting distributions are unknown. This paper assesses the uncertainty generated by using different climate predictor variable sets for modelling the impacts of climate change.Location Europe, 10° W to 50° E and 30° N to 60° N.Methods Using 1453 presence pixels at 30 arcsec resolution for the great bustard (Otis tarda), predictions of future distribution were made based on two emissions scenarios, three general climate models and 26 sets of predictor variables. Twenty-six current models were created, and 156 for both 2050 and 2080. Map comparison techniques were used to compare predictions in terms of the quantity and the location of presences (map comparison kappa, MCK) and using a range change index (RCI). Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to partition explained deviance in MCK and RCI among sources of uncertainty.Results The 26 different variable sets achieved high values of AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and yet introduced substantial variation into maps of current distribution. Differences between maps were even greater when distributions were projected into the future. Some 64–78{\%} of the variation between future maps was attributable to choice of predictor variable set alone. Choice of general climate model and emissions scenario contributed a maximum of 15{\%} variation and their order of importance differed for MCK and RCI.Main conclusions Generalized variable sets produce an unmanageable level of uncertainty in species distribution models which cannot be ignored. The use of sound ecological theory and statistical methods to check predictor variables can reduce this uncertainty, but our knowledge of species may be too limited to make more than arbitrary choices. When all sources of modelling uncertainty are considered together, it is doubtful whether ensemble methods offer an adequate solution. Future studies should explicitly acknowledge uncertainty due to arbitrary choices in the model-building process and develop ways to convey the results to decision-makers.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems in southern Ecuador are strongly affected by interannual climate variations. This holds especially true for the episodic El Ni{\~{n}}o events, which cause above-normal precipitation in the coastal region of Ecuador and below normal values in the eastern provinces of the Amazon basin (Bendix, 1999). For the transitional zone between these two extremes, which consists mainly of the andean slopes and larger interandean basins the effect on interannual climate variability is not well known. The PREDICT project monitors regional climate in the provinces of Loja and Zamora-Chinchipe (4 S/79 W), where a strong gradients of precipitation are observed. Between the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Real and the dry valley of Catamayo, which are only 70km apart, rain totals drop from over 4000 mm to only 300 mm per year. These two extremes represent the both sides of the Andean mountain chain and are completely covered by the study area, which is 120 km in diameter. Methods used are a combination of point measurements (climate stations) and remote sensing devices (weather radar, satellite imagery), which enable a high-resolution real-time observation of rain distribution and underlying processes. By this, ideal conditions are given to monitor a potential shift of the transition zone between below-average and above-average rainfall situated in this region, if another ENSO-anomaly occurs. Furthermore variability of atmospheric nutrient inputs is analysed within the scope of the project, to assess further impacts on this ecosystem.},

abstract = {Abstract The availability of key plant nutrients may change with elevation in tropical mountains due to altitudinal gradients in temperature and moisture which affect pedogenesis and nutrient cycling. In a transect from upper lowland to montane forests in NE Ecuador, we tested the hypotheses that (1) the availability of P is low in low-elevation forests but increases upslope,while the availability of N is relatively high at low elevations but decreases with elevation, and (2) increasing amounts of calcium, magnesium and potassium are stored on top of the soil with progressive humus accumulation toward higher elevations, likely to improve nutrient availability. In each 20 plots in undisturbed natural forest at 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000ma.s.l.,wemeasured in situ Nnet mineralization and nitrification rate (NNM and NNI, buried bag method), plant-available phosphorus (Pa, resin-bag method), and salt-exchangeable calcium, potassium and magnesium concentrations (Caex,Kex, Mgex) in the organic and mineral topsoils. NNM and NNI,and the Caex,Kex and Mgex concentrations were much more variable at the plot level than across the four elevations, while Pa varied equally at small and large spatial scales. Pa increased more than 10fold from 500 to 2000 m. The net release of nitrate dominated over ammonium at all elevations. While mass-related NNM and NNI rates and also organic matter C/N ratio in the topsoil remained invariant along the slope, NNM and NNI rates per ground area decreased by about 40{\%}from 500 to2000m. Thus, theNNM/Pa ratio decreased markedly with elevation proving our first hypothesis. In support of the second hypothesis, the pools of Caex, Mgex and Kex in the organic layers increased with elevation, demonstrating the key role that organic topsoil horizons are playing for forest nutrition at high elevations. We suggest that the large difference in N versus P availability of tropical (upper) lowland and montane forests is likely to be a key factor influencing the species composition and productivity along tropical mountain slopes.},

These techniques have potential application to the initial surveys of candidate habitats for Marine Protected Areas, and to the subsequent monitoring necessary to manage them. Remote video techniques can be used in shelf depths beyond the limits of diver-based Underwater Visual Census (UVC), and stereo-video systems can also be used to complement and enhance normal UVC by allowing very precise and accurate estimates of fish morphometrics (and hence weight). Some video techniques are very cost-effective and can help remove some major sources of observer bias in underwater observations, by removing the need for skilled observers in the field and by allowing simultaneous collection of a much wider suite of information in a permanent record that can be analysed later. This medium is directly accessible to an unlimited audience. Baited, remote video techniques offer a non-intrusive, depth-independent assessment tool with the advantages of both diver-based observation and capture techniques, but appropriate sampling statistics must be developed if relative abundance is to be measured adequately.},

abstract = {Tropical rain forests represent some of the most diverse ecosystems on earth, yet mechanistic links between tree species identity and ecosystem function in these forests remains poorly understood. Here, using free-living nitrogen (N) fixation as a model, we explore the idea that interspecies variation in canopy nutrient concentrations may drive significant local-scale variation in biogeochemical processes. Biological N fixation is the largest "natural" source of newly available N to terrestrial ecosystems, and estimates suggest the highest such inputs occur in tropical ecosystems. While patterns of and controls over N fixation in these systems remain poorly known, the data we do have suggest that chemical differences among tree species canopies could affect free-living N fixation rates. In a diverse lowland rain forest in Costa Rica, we established a series of vertical, canopy-to-soil profiles for six common canopy tree species, and we measured free-living N fixation rates and multiple aspects of chemistry of live canopy leaves, senesced canopy leaves, bulk leaf litter, and soil for eight individuals of each tree species. Free-living N fixation rates varied significantly among tree species for all four components, and independent of species identity, rates of N fixation ranged by orders of magnitude along the vertical profile. Our data suggest that variations in phosphorus (P) concentration drove a significant fraction of the observed species-specific variation in free-living N fixation rates within each layer of the vertical profile. Furthermore, our data suggest significant links between canopy and forest floor nutrient concentrations; canopy P was correlated with bulk leaf litter P below individual tree crowns. Thus, canopy chemistry may affect a suite of ecosystem processes not only within the canopy itself, but at and beneath the forest floor as well.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate nutrient composition, voluntary DMI, and apparent DM digestibility of teff hay cut at 3 different stages of maturity to evaluate its potential as a preserved forage for horses. Six mature Quarter Horse mares (12 +/- 3 yr; 553 +/- 39 kg of BW) were used in a replicated balanced Latin square design with 3 periods and 3 maturities of teff hay. Eragrostis tef ('Tiffany' teff) was planted in May and harvested at the boot, early-heading, or late-heading stage of maturity through the summer. Horses were acclimated to a mixture of maturities of teff hay for 8 d before the beginning of the study. After this acclimation period, each period consisted of a 9-d voluntary DMI phase, followed by a 3-d DM digestibility phase. The percentages of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) increased from 5.4{\%} in the boot stage to 8.4{\%} in the late-heading stage, whereas concentrations of CP, K, Fe, and Mn decreased. The Ca:P ratio was 2.0 ± 0.3 for all maturities. Horses had less DMI of late-heading teff hay (1.5{\%} BW) than teff hay of other maturities (1.8{\%} BW; P {\textless} 0.05), indicating a preference for the earlier maturities. The intake and nutrient composition of the boot and early-heading maturities was sufficient to meet 90 to 97{\%} of the average DE of the horses and most other nutrient requirements. Digestibility decreased from boot to late-heading teff hay for DM, CP, ADF, and NDF (P {\textless} 0.05). Digestibility increased from boot to early-heading to late-heading hay for nonfiber carbohydrates and water-soluble carbohydrates (P {\textless} 0.05). For all maturities of teff hay, the NSC intake was below 10{\%} of the total intake. In conclusion, the low NSC and DE of teff hay grown in central Pennsylvania under the conditions in this study make it an appropriate forage source for obese horses and those at risk for laminitis or other metabolic disorders.},

abstract = {Being ecologically important and well-known, the spatial distribution pattern of the macrobenthos is often used to support an ecologically sustainable marine management. Though in many cases the macrobenthic spatial distribution is relatively well-known, this information is merely restricted to point observations at the sampling stations: although being increasingly demanded, full coverage spatial distribution maps are generally lacking. This study therefore aimed at demonstrating the usefulness of habitat suitability modelling as a full coverage mapping tool with high relevance for marine management through (1) the construction of a habitat suitability model for the soft sediment macrobenthic communities in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) and (2) predicting the full coverage spatial distribution of macrobenthic communities within the BPNS. The BPNS was selected as a case study area because of the high data availability on both macrobenthos and environmental characteristics. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) objectively selected median grain size and sediment mud content and omitted bathymetry, slope and distance to the coast to represent the most important environmental variables determining the macrobenthic community distribution. The consequent crossvalidated, empirical habitat suitability model, using both median grain size and mud content, showed an a posteriori average correctly classified instances (CCI) of 79{\%} (community-dependent CCI ranging from 72{\%} to 86{\%}) and a Cohen's kappa of 0.71, pointing towards a very good agreement between model predictions and observations. The application of the habitat suitability model on the full coverage maps of median grain size and sediment mud content, taken from literature, allowed to reliably assess the distribution of the macrobenthic communities within 96.3{\%} of the 53,297 BPNS grid cells with a resolution of 250 m. Next to its applicability to the BPNS, the model is further anticipated to potentially perform well in the full Southern Bight of the North Sea: testing is advised here. Since the habitat suitability is considered far more stable through time compared to the permanently fluctuating macrobenthic communities, information on the habitat suitability of an area is considered highly important for a scientifically sound marine management. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The set-up, application and validation of a generic ecological model (GEM) for estuaries and coastal waters is presented. This model is a comprehensive ecological model of the bottom of the foodweb, consisting of a set of modules, representing specific water quality processes and primary production that can be combined with any transport model to create a dedicated model for a specific ecosystem. GEM links different physical, chemical and ecological model components into one generic and flexible modelling tool that allows for variable sized, curvilinear grids to accomodate both the requirements for local accuracy while maintaining a relatively short model run-time. The GEM model describes the behaviour of nutrients, organic matter and primary producers in estuaries and coastal waters, incorporating dynamic process modules for dissolved oxygen, nutrients and phytoplankton. GEM integrates the best aspects of existing Dutch estuarine models that were mostly dedicated to only one type of ecosystem, geographic area or subset of processes. Particular strengths of GEM include its generic applicability and the integration and interaction of biological, chemical and physical processes into one predictive tool. The model offers flexibility in choosing which processes to include, and the ability to integrate results from different processes modelled simultaneously with different temporal resolutions. The generic applicability of the model is illustrated using a number of representative examples from case studies in which the GEM model was successfully applied. Validation of these examples was carried out using the ‘cost function' to compare model results with field observations. The validation results demonstrated consistent accuracy of the GEM model for various key parameters in both spatial dimensions (horizontally and vertically) as well as temporal dimensions (seasonally and across years) for a variety of water systems without the need for major reparameterisation.},

abstract = {Top-kriging is a method for estimating stream flow-related variables on a river network. Top-kriging treats these variables as emerging from a two-dimensional spatially continuous process in the landscape. The top-kriging weights are estimated by regularising the point variogram over the catchment area (kriging support), which accounts for the nested nature of the catchments. We test the top-kriging method for a comprehensive Austrian data set of low stream flows. We compare it with the regional regression approach where linear regression models between low stream flow and catchment characteristics are fitted independently for sub-regions of the study area that are deemed to be homogeneous in terms of flow processes. Leave-one-out cross-validation results indicate that top-kriging outperforms the regional regression on average over the entire study domain. The coefficients of determination (cross-validation) of specific low stream flows are 0.75 and 0.68 for the top-kriging and regional regression methods, respectively. For locations without upstream data points, the performances of the two methods are similar. For locations with upstream data points, top-kriging performs much better than regional regression as it exploits the low flow information of the neighbouring locations.

Acoustic telemetry is one of the primary tools for the assessment of animal movements in aquatic systems through either manual tracking or the establishment of fixed receiving sta- tions. Recent technological developments in code division multiple access (CDMA) acous- tic telemetry now enable the simultaneous real-time monitoring of numerous individual fish at fine time scales providing APA researchers with a robust new tool. Fish can be positioned in three-dimensions with sub-meter accuracy in both deep and shallow waters. Here, we describe a whole-lake environmental observatory that includes a 13-hydrophone acoustic telemetry array that has been used to monitor the position of 22 tagged fish at 15 sec intervals. Although we use a freshwater fish and environment as a case study, this telemetry system is equally useful for marine environments including under-ice. We evaluate the ap- plicability of CDMA MAP technology to address pressing questions in applied APA research. The CDMA MAP system provides the flexibility to collect information at multiple spatial- temporal scales, responding to the varied levels of detail and precision required for different applications in APA research. When combined with the suite of other telemetry and monitor- ing approaches available, CDMA MAP technology will enable researchers to document the spatial ecology essential for improving APA science. Furthermore, because numerous ani- mals from different trophic levels can be tracked in real time, CDMA MAP technology will also aid in our understanding of complex community-level dynamics consistent with the shift towards ecosystem-based APA management.},

abstract = {Species distribution modelling is central to both fundamental and applied research in biogeography. Despite widespread use of models, there are still important conceptual ambiguities as well as biotic and algorithmic uncertainties that need to be investigated in order to increase confidence in model results. We identify and discuss five areas of enquiry that are of high importance for species distribution modelling: (1) clarification of the niche concept; (2) improved designs for sampling data for building models; (3) improved parameterization; (4) improved model selection and predictor contribution; and (5) improved model evaluation. The challenges discussed in this essay do not preclude the need for developments of other areas of research in this field. However, they are critical for allowing the science of species distribution modelling to move forward.},

abstract = {Can remote underwater video be used to investigate the in-stream behaviour of small fishes and decapods? Diel activity of two threatened freshwater fishes (Macquaria australasica and Gadopsis bispinosus), a palaemonid prawn and an atyid shrimp, was established from remote underwater video in a pool of an upland stream in the current study. Decapods and large fishes ({\textgreater} 5 cm TL) were nocturnal, whereas, small fishes ({\textless} 5 cm TL) were diurnal. The suitability of using underwater video to quantify short-term (seconds) behavioural interaction among individuals was also demonstrated, with early-juvenile-phase Gadopsis bispinosus exhibiting interference competition on 35{\%} of occasions when two or more individuals were observed. This study demonstrates that remote underwater video is useful for observing the in-stream behaviour of threatened freshwater fauna where other techniques are not viable, and presents sub-sampling of video as a means of reducing video processing time in assessing fish diel activity patterns.},

abstract = {The upstream migration of adult anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) has been dramatically altered and fish may be experiencing energetically costly delays at dams. To explore this notion, we estimated the energetic costs of migration and reproduction of Yakima River-bound spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha using a sequential analysis of their proximate composition (i.e., percent water, fat, protein, and ash). Tissues (muscle, viscera, and gonad) were sampled from fish near the start of their migration (Bonneville Dam), at a mid point (Roza Dam, 510km upstream from Bonneville Dam) and from fresh carcasses on the spawning grounds (about 100km above Roza Dam). At Bonneville Dam, the energy reserves of these fish were remarkably high, primarily due to the high percentage of fat in the muscle (18–20{\%}; energy content over 11 kJ g?1). The median travel time for fish from Bonneville to Roza Dam was 27 d and ranged from 18 to 42 d. Fish lost from 6 to 17{\%} of their energy density in muscle, depending on travel time. On average, fish taking a relatively long time for migration between dams used from 5 to 8{\%}more energy from the muscle than faster fish. From the time they passed Bonneville Damto death, these fish, depending on gender, used 95–99{\%} of their muscle and 73–86{\%} of their visceral lipid stores. Also, both sexes used about 32{\%} of their muscular and very little of their visceral protein stores. However, we were unable to relate energy use and reproductive success to migration history. Our results suggest a possible influence of the CRB hydroelectric system on adult salmonid energetics},

Here, we present the results of a process-based modeling esti- mate ofGPP, using a soil–plant–atmospheremodel,of a high elevation Peruvian TMCF. The model was parameterizedwithfield-measured physiological and structural vegetation variables, and driven with meteorological data from the site.

The strongest environ- mental controls on simulated GPP were variation of photosynthetic active radiation and air temperature (Tair). Their relative importance likely varies with elevation and the local prevalence of cloud cover. Photosynthetic parameters (Vcmax and Jmax)and leaf area index were the most important non-environ- mental controls on GPP. We additionally compared themodeled results with a recent estimate of GPP of the same Peruvian TMCF derived by the summing of ecosystem respiration and net productivity terms, which added up to 26 Mg C ha-1 y-1.Despite the uncertainties in modeling GPP we conclude that at this altitude GPP is, conservatively estimated, 30– 40{\%} lower than in lowland rainforest and this dif- ference is drivenmostly by cooler temperatures than changes in other parameters},

It further considers why we need to define an estuary and its constituent parts, including the fundamental difficulty and dilemma of trying to define parts of a continuum, as a means to both understanding and managing that estuary. The review considers where an estuary starts and ends and the relative merits of defining estuaries in terms of their biology, physics, chemistry, geographic nature and socio-economic units. It briefly discusses the need for legal and planning definitions and the linkages between science and management. Following this, we present a generic framework for the definition, classification, monitoring, assessment, reporting and management of estuaries. In particular, it is argued that scientists should engage in the debate on the definition of estuaries for legal and socio-economic purposes. It is concluded here that as existing definitions will never be suitable for all needs, a different approach is required. The proposed ‘Expert Judgement Checklist Approach' could provide guidance for those needing to define/delimit an estuary while still acknowledging the inherent variability of such systems. The proposed system mostly relates to the European, temperate estuary, but there are lessons here for estuaries worldwide.},

abstract = {We hindcast a 110 year period (1860-1970) of morphodynamic behavior of the Western Scheldt estuary by means of a 2D, high resolution, process-based model and compare results to a historically unique bathymetric dataset. Initially the model skill decreases for a few decades. Against common perception, the model skill increases after that to become excellent after 110 years. We attribute this to the self-organization of the morphological system which is reproduced correctly by the numerical model. On time scales exceeding decades, the interaction between the major tidal forcing and the confinement of the estuary overrules other uncertainties. Both measured and modeled bathymetries reflect a trend of decreasing energy dissipation, less morphodynamic activity and thus a more stable morphology over time, albeit that the estuarine adaptation time is long ({\~{}}centuries). Process-based models applied in confined environments and under constant forcing conditions may perform well especially on long ({\textgreater} decades) time scales. },

abstract = {Numerical modeling has emerged over the last several decades as a widely accepted tool for investigations in environmental sciences. In estuarine research, hydrodynamic and ecological models have moved along parallel tracks with regard to complexity, refinement, computational power, and incorporation of uncertainty. Coupled hydrodynamic-ecological models have been used to assess ecosystem processes and interactions, simulate future scenarios, and evaluate remedial actions in response to eutrophication, habitat loss, and freshwater diversion. The need to couple hydrodynamic and ecological models to address research and management questions is clear because dynamic feedbacks between biotic and physical processes are critical interactions within ecosystems. In this review, we present historical and modern perspectives on estuarine hydrodynamic and ecological modeling, consider model limitations, and address aspects of model linkage, skill assessment, and complexity. We discuss the balance between spatial and temporal resolution and present examples using different spatiotemporal scales. Finally, we recommend future lines of inquiry, approaches to balance complexity and uncertainty, and model transparency and utility. It is idealistic to think we can pursue a “theory of everything” for estuarine models, but recent advances suggest that models for both scientific investigations and management applications will continue to improve in terms of realism, precision, and accuracy.},

abstract = {1. Animal migration has long intrigued scientists and wildlife managers alike, yet migratory species face increasing challenges because of habitat fragmentation, climate change and over-exploitation. Central to the understanding migratory species is the objective discrimination between migratory and nonmigratory individuals in a given population, quantifying the timing, duration and distance of migration and the ability to predict migratory movements. 2. Here, we propose a uniform statistical framework to (i) separate migration from other movement behaviours, (ii) quantify migration parameters without the need for arbitrary cut-off criteria and (iii) test predictability across individuals, time and space. 3. We first validated our novel approach by simulating data based on established theoretical movement patterns. We then formulated the expected shapes of squared displacement patterns as nonlinear models for a suite of movement behaviours to test the ability of our method to distinguish between migratory movement and other movement types. 4. We then tested our approached empirically using 108 wild Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared moose Alces alces in Scandinavia as a study system because they exhibit a wide range of movement behaviours, including resident, migrating and dispersing individuals, within the same population. Applying our approach showed that 87{\%} and 67{\%} of our Swedish and Norwegian subpopulations, respectively, can be classified as migratory. 5. Using nonlinear mixed effects models for all migratory individuals we showed that the distance, timing and duration of migration differed between the sexes and between years, with additional individual differences accounting for a large part of the variation in the distance of migration but not in the timing or duration. Overall, the model explained most of the variation (92{\%}) and also had high predictive power for the same individuals over time (69{\%}) as well as between study populations (74{\%}). 6. The high predictive ability of the approach suggests that it can help increase our understanding of the drivers of migration and could provide key quantitative information for understanding and managing a broad range of migratory species.},

abstract = {Presence-only data, for which there is no information on locations where the species is absent, are common in both animal and plant studies. In many situations, these may be the only data available on a species. We need effective ways to use these data to explore species distribution or species use of habitat. Many analytical approaches have been used to model presence-only data, some inappropriately. We provide a synthesis and critique of statistical methods currently in use to both estimate and evaluate these models, and discuss the critical importance of study design in models where only presence can be identified Profile or envelope methods exist to characterize environmental covariates that describe the locations where organisms are found. Predictions from profile approaches are generally coarse, but may be useful when species records, environmental predictors and biological understanding are scarce. Alternatively, one can build models to contrast environmental attributes associated with known locations with a sample of random landscape locations, termed either 'pseudo-absences' or 'available'. Great care needs to be taken when selecting random landscape locations, because the way in which they are selected determines the modelling techniques that can be applied. Regression-based models can provide predictions of the relative likelihood of occurrence, and in some situations predictions of the probability of occurrence. The logistic model is frequently applied, but can rarely be used directly to estimate these models; instead, case2013control or logistic discrimination should be used depending on the sample design. Cross-validation can be used to evaluate model performance and to assess how effectively the model reflects a quantity proportional to the probability of occurrence. However, more research is needed to develop a single measure or statistic that summarizes model performance for presence-only data. Synthesis and applications. A number of statistical procedures are available to explore patterns in presence-only data; the choice among them depends on the quality of the presence-only data. Presence-only records can provide insight into the vulnerability, historical distribution and conservation status of species. Models developed using these data can inform management. Our caveat is that researchers must be mindful of study design and the biases inherent in presence data, and be cautious in the interpretation of model predictions.

We compared the microclimate, photosynthetic gas exchange, and water relations of Fraser fir trees in open areas during cloud-immersed, low-cloud, or sunny periods. In contrast to sunny periods, cloud immersion reduced instantaneous sunlight irradiance by 10-50{\%}, and midday atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was 85{\%} lower. Needle surfaces were wet for up to 16 h per day during cloud-immersed days compared to {\textless}1 h for clear days. Shoot-level light-saturated photosynthesis (A (sat)) on both cloud-immersed (16.0 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) and low-cloud (17.9 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) days was greater than A (sat) on sunny days (14.4 micromol m(-2) s(-1)). Daily mean A was lowest on cloud-immersed days due to reduced sunlight levels, while leaf conductance (g) was significantly higher, with a mean value of 0.30 mol m(-2) s(-1). These g values were greater than commonly reported for conifer tree species with needle-like leaves, and declined exponentially with increasing leaf-to-air VPD. Daily mean transpiration (E) on immersed days was 43 and 20{\%} lower compared to sunny and low-cloud days, respectively. As a result, daily mean water use efficiency (A/E) was lowest on cloud-immersed days due to light limitation of A, and high humidity resulted in greater uncoupling of A from g. Thus, substantial differences in photosynthetic CO2 uptake, and corresponding water relations, were strongly associated with cloud conditions that occur over substantial periods of the summer growth season.},

abstract = {Carbon storage and sequestration in tropical mountain forests and their dependence on elevation and temperature are not well understood. In an altitudinal transect study in the South Ecuadorian Andes, we tested the hypotheses that (i) aboveground net primary production (ANPP) decreases continuously with elevation due to decreasing temperatures, whereas (ii) belowground productivity (BNPP) remains constant or even increases with elevation due to a shift from light to nutrient limitation of tree growth. In five tropical mountain forests between 1050 and 3060 m a.s.l., we investigated all major above- and belowground biomass and productivity components, and the stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC). Leaf biomass, stemwood mass and total aboveground biomass (AGB) decreased by 50{\%} to 70{\%}, ANPP by about 70{\%} between 1050 and 3060 m, while stem wood production decreased 20-fold. Coarse and large root biomass increased slightly, fine root biomass fourfold, while fine root production (minirhizotron study) roughly doubled between 1050 and 3060 m. The total tree biomass (above- and belowground) decreased from about 320 to 175 Mg dry mass ha-1, total NPP from ca. 13.0 to 8.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1. The belowground/aboveground ratio of biomass and productivity increased with elevation indicating a shift from light to nutrient limitation of tree growth. We propose that, with increasing elevation, an increasing nitrogen limitation combined with decreasing temperatures causes a large reduction in stand leaf area resulting in a substantial reduction of canopy carbon gain toward the alpine tree line. We conclude that the marked decrease in tree height, AGB and ANPP with elevation in these mountain forests is caused by both a belowground shift of C allocation and a reduction in C source strength, while a temperature-induced reduction in C sink strength (lowered meristematic activity) seems to be of secondary importance.},

abstract = {Forest systems cover more than 4.1 x 109 hectares of the Earth's land area. Globally, forest vegetation and soils contain about 1146 petagrams of carbon, with approximately 37 percent of this carbon in low-latitude forests, 14 percent in mid-latitudes, and 49 percent at high latitudes. Over two-thirds of the carbon in forest ecosystems is contained in soils and associated peat deposits. In 1990, deforestation in the low latitudes emitted 1.6 ± 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year, whereas forest area expansion and growth in mid- and high-latitude forest sequestered 0.7 ± 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year, for a net flux to the atmosphere of 0.9 ± 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year. Slowing deforestation, combined with an increase in forestation and other management measures to improve forest ecosystem productivity, could conserve or sequester significant quantities of carbon. Future forest carbon cycling trends attributable to losses and regrowth associated with global climate and land-use change are uncertain. Model projections and some results suggest that forests could be carbon sinks or sources in the future.},

abstract = {Macroecological models for predicting species distributions usually only include abiotic environ- mental conditions as explanatory variables, despite knowledge from community ecology that all species are linked to other species through biotic interactions. This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interac- tions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species dis- tribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species' presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change. Keywords},

abstract = {Water management in urban areas goes beyond the supply of drinking water or the collection and treatment of waste water. There is a growing interest in the use of Information Communication Technology (ICT), resulting in a large number of new applications that provide access to vast amounts of information generated by the diverse facilities, unthinkable a few years ago, which greatly facilitate the operation, maintenance and management tasks in a context of efficient and sustainable urban development. In this context water management is particularly important, especially when one considers the huge growth in demand in recent years in developed areas where the water footprint is increasing. The proper use of ICTs applied to urban water management allows gathering data to know in real time about supply and demand and put this information in the hands of managers to help them predictively manage demand, or adapt prices based on the demand. Encompassing every aspect related to water management and monitoring in a global platform is known as IWRM (Integrated Water Resources Management). These IWRM systems need a large amount of information to manage, with precision, water systems in urban environments. This information falls under three main headings: generation, transport and consumption; each of them presenting different characteristics thus demanding different treatment solutions. Currently there are numerous initiatives working in the field of ICT applied to water management, some of which will be outlined in this chapter.},

abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) typically experience conditions of frequent to persistent fog. On the basis of the altitudinal limits between which TMCF generally occur (800-3500 m.a.s.l. depending on mountain size and distance to coast) their current areal extent is estimated at similar to 215 000 km(2) or 6.6{\%} of all montane tropical forests. Alternatively, on the basis of remotely sensed frequencies of cloud occurrence, fog-affected forest may occupy as much as 2.21 Mkm(2). Four hydrologically distinct montane forest types may be distinguished, viz. lower montane rain forest below the cloud belt (LMRF), tall lower montane cloud forest (LMCF), upper montane cloud forest (UMCF) of intermediate stature and a group that combines stunted sub-alpine cloud forest (SACF) and 'elfin' cloud forest (ECF). Average throughfall to precipitation ratios increase from 0.72 +/- 0.07 in LMRF (n = 15) to 0.81 +/- 0.11 in LMCF (n = 23), to 1.0 +/- 0.27 (n = 18) and 1.04 +/- 0.25 (n = 8) in UMCF and SACF-ECF, respectively. Average stemflow fractions increase from LMRF to UMCF and ECF, whereas leaf area index (LAI) and annual evapotranspiration (ET) decrease along the same sequence. Although the data sets for UMCF (n = 3) and ECF (n = 2) are very limited, the ET from UMCF (783 +/- 112 mm) and ECF (547 +/- 25 mm) is distinctly lower than that from LMCF (1188 +/- 239 mm, n = 9) and LMRF (1280 +/- 72 mm; n = 7). Field-measured annual 'cloud-water' interception (CWI) totals determined with the wet-canopy water budget method (WCWB) vary widely between locations and range between 22 and 1990 mm (n = 15). Field measured values also tend to be much larger than modelled amounts of fog interception, particularly at exposed sites. This is thought to reflect a combination of potential model limitations, a mismatch between the scale at which the model was applied (1 x 1 km) and the scale of the measurements (small plots), as well as the inclusion of near-horizontal wind-driven precipitation in the WCWB-based estimate of CWI. Regional maps of modelled amounts of fog interception across the tropics are presented, showing major spatial variability. Modelled contributions by CWI make up less than 5{\%} of total precipitation in wet areas to more than 75{\%} in low-rainfall areas. Catchment water yields typically increase from LMRF to UMCF and SACF-ECF reflecting concurrent increases in incident precipitation and decreases in evaporative losses. The conversion of LMCF (or LMRF) to pasture likely results in substantial increases in water yield. Changes in water yield after UMCF conversion are probably modest due to trade-offs between concurrent changes in ET and CWI. General circulation model (GCM)-projected rates of climatic drying under SRES greenhouse gas scenarios to the year 2050 are considered to have a profound effect on TMCF hydrological functioning and ecology, although different GCMs produce different and sometimes opposing results. Whilst there have been substantial increases in our understanding of the hydrological processes operating in TMCF, additional research is needed to improve the quantification of occult precipitation inputs (CWI and wind-driven precipitation), and to better understand the hydrological impacts of climate-and land-use change.},

abstract = {A "snapshot" of the fish-habitat associations in the vicinity of James Price Point was obtained during a single expedition in October 2009, when Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) were deployed in coastal waters to survey the demersal and semi-demersal ichthyofauna. A total of 7108 individuals from 116 species of fishes, sharks, rays and sea snakes were recorded from 154 sites. Bony fishes were represented by 8 orders, and cartilaginous fishes were well represented by the Carcharhiniformes, Rajiformes and Orectolobiformes. There were 2 species of hydrophiid sea snakes. Multivariate analysis showed that species responded to the amount of epibenthic cover in the study area and that there was an interaction between depth and sediment composition, as well as depth and epibenthic cover, in defining four fish assemblages to the north and south of James Price Point. Diversity appeared to increase with depth amongst these assemblages. The sandy seabed offshore from James Price Point was inhabited by a "deep sandy" fish assemblage, which intruded inshore across the study area, and was characterised by the presence of ponyfish (Leiognathus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus) and queenfish (Scomberoides). On either side were shallow, northern and deeper, southern, assemblages inhabiting "gardens" of macroalgae, filter-feeders and some seagrass beds. These epibenthic habitats at the northern and southern ends of the survey area were clearly important to many species, but in general there appeared to be little association of particular vertebrate species or biotic habitat types with the James Price Point area itself. The study area was notable for the diversity and abundance of the fauna, given the shallow depth, lack of rugose seafloor topography and lack of sub-tidal coral reefs in the area sampled. Coarse comparison with the fauna at similar distance to shore in similar latitudes in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the Burrup Peninsula and the Kimberley indicated that the study area had more small pelagic planktivores and more large semi-demersal predators. There was also an absence of some species normally associated with muddy seafloors and fringing coral reefs that are common on BRUVS set elsewhere in regions with less extreme tidal ranges. {\textcopyright} Royal Society of Western Australia 2011.},

Various mechanistic models exist to date, but their applications seem to be scattered and far from evenly distributed across taxonomic units. * Therefore, we provide an overview of the major mechanistic modelling approaches used in the study of migration behaviour and characterize their fundamental features, assumptions and limitations and discuss their typical data requirements both for model parameterization and for scrutinizing model predictions. * Furthermore, we review 155 studies that have used mechanistic models to study animal migration and analyse them with regard to the approaches used and the focal species, and also explore their contribution to advancing current knowledge within six broad migration ecology research themes. * This identifies important gaps in our present knowledge, which should be tackled in future research using existing and to-be developed theoretical approaches.},

abstract = {The productivity of tropical lowland moist forests is often considered to be limited by the availability of phosphorus. Organic phosphorus is often abundant in tropical soils, but its role in forest nutrition is largely unknown. We addressed this by using a large-scale litter manipulation experiment to investigate the stability of soil organic phosphorus in a tropical lowland forest in Central Panama. Three years of litter removal reduced the organic phosphorus concentration in the surface 2 cm of mineral soil by 23{\%}, as determined by NaOH-EDTA extraction and 31P-NMR spectroscopy; this included decreases in phosphate monoesters (20{\%}) and DNA (30{\%}). Three years of litter addition (equivalent to adding 6 kg P ha-1 per year) increased soil organic phosphorus by 16{\%}, which included a 31{\%} increase in DNA. We did not detect higher-order inositol phosphates, despite their abundance in mineral soils of temperate ecosystems. Our observed turnover rate suggests that even the 0-2-cm layer of the mineral soil contributes a fifth of the total phosphorus needed to sustain above-ground growth in this forest. Soil organic phosphorus is thus likely to make a more important contribution to the nutrition of semi-evergreen forest plants than has hitherto been acknowledged. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2009 British Society of Soil Science.},

Here, we describe evidence of correlated genetic and life history (spawning season linked to spawning location) differentiation in an abundant and highly migratory pelagic fish, Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, in the North Sea (NS) and adjacent areas. The existence of genetically and phenotypically diverse stocks in this region despite intense seasonal mixing strongly implicates natal homing in this species. Based on information from genetic markers and otolith morphology, we estimate the proportional contribution by NS, Skagerrak (SKG) and Kattegat and western Baltic (WBS) fish to mixed aggregations targeted by the NS fishery. We use these estimates to identify spatial and temporal differences in life history (migratory behaviour) and habitat use among genetically differentiated migratory populations that mix seasonally. Our study suggests the existence of more complex patterns of intraspecific diversity than was previously recognized. Sustainability may be compromised if such complex patterns are reduced through generalized management (e.g. area closures) that overlooks population differences in spatial use throughout the life cycle.},

abstract = {Experimental evidence for limitation of net primary productivity (NPP) by nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) in lowland tropical forests is rare, and the results from the few existing studies have been inconclusive. To directly test if N or P limit NPP in a lowland tropical wet forest in Costa Rica, we conducted a full factorial fertilization experiment (4 treatments × 6 replicates in 30 × 30 m plots). We focused on the influence of tree size and taxa on nutrient limitation, because in these forests a wide variety of tree functional traits related to nutrient acquisition and use are likely to regulate biogeochemical processes. After 2.7 years, a higher percentage of trees per plot increased basal area (BA) with P additions (66.45{\%} ± 3.28{\%} without P vs. 76.88{\%} ± 3.28{\%} with P), but there were no other community-level responses to N or P additions on BA increase, litterfall productivity, or root growth. Phosphorus additions resulted in doubled stem growth rates in small trees (5–10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh); [P ≤ 0.01]) but had no effect on intermediate (10–30 cm dbh) or large trees ({\textgreater}30 cm dbh). Phosphorus additions also increased the percentage of seedling survival from 59{\%} to 78{\%} (P {\textless} 0.01), as well as the percentage of seedlings that grew (P = 0.03), and increased leaf number (P = 0.02). Trees from Pentaclethra macroloba, the most abundant species, did not increase growth rates with fertilization (P = 0.40). In contrast, the most abundant palms (Socratea exorrhiza) had more than two times higher stem growth rates with P additions (P = 0.01). Our experiment reiterates that P availability is a significant driver of plant processes in these systems, but highlights the importance of considering different aspects of the plant community when making predictions concerning nutrient limitation. We postulate that in diverse, lowland tropical forests “heterogeneous nutrient limitation” occurs, not only driven by variability in nutrient responses among taxa, but also among size classes and potential functional groups. Heterogeneous responses to nutrient additions could lead to changes in forest structure or even diversity in the long term, affecting rates of NPP and thus carbon cycling.

Richness increased slightly toward the equator. Nine terminal vertebrate communities parallel to the coast were distinguished inshore and offshore in deep and shallow water along a latitudinal gradient. There were important community boundaries at Bowen in the south, Townsville in the centre, and Cape Flattery in the north. Latitudinal groupings were most evident inshore. Offshore communities were spatially extensive and separated lagoonal, mid-shelf and outer-shelf sites.

Based on 8-year records (1996–2004) of migrant silver eels captured in a Wolf trap located about 1 km below the dam, the influence of this dam on the migration was examined. These records indicate that 91{\%} of silver eels were captured when the dam was overtopped (i.e. when the water reservoir was full). The timings of the overflow periods varied greatly between years mainly because they are function of the duration of the filling period which in turn is dependent on the level of summer water abstraction and annual hydrological conditions. Consequently, migration periods occurred at variable dates (between November and April) which is late in comparison with nonobstructed European river systems (generally between August and December). During overflow periods the migration of silver eels increased markedly during rain events (increasing river flow). This indicates that flow flushes, are essential so that settled silver eels can orientate themselves and pass over the dam. The hypothesis of a ‘dam effect' that could stop temporarily or permanently some of silver eels in the reservoir is discussed. Finally, the influence of the migration delays on the condition of silver eels is considered.},

Compared with pasture, soils under bamboo at the above three depths had greater total C and N concentrations, and lower bulk densities. Because of the difference in soil bulk density between pasture and bamboo systems, C and N stock was calculated based on 30-cm soil depth in bamboo and corrected soil depth in pasture (22.6 cm) that provided soil mass equal to that under bamboo. The soil C stock at "eouivalent 0-30" cm depth was greater under bamboo (60.8-123 Mg ha ! 1) than that under pasture (33.4-75.3 Mg ha(-1)). The carbon stock of bamboo standing biomass (51.8-95.6 Mg ha(-1)) was remarkably greater than that of pasture standing biomass (3.53-8.14 Mg ha(-1)). Higher soil N stock and lower C/N ratio were observed under bamboo than under pasture. Our results suggest that more C would be stored in terrestrial ecosystems with the planting of bamboo to degraded (pasture) soils in the Andes.},

abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {CO2 transfer conductance from the intercellular airspaces of the leaf into the chloroplast, defined as mesophyll conductance (g m ), is finite. Therefore, it will limit photosynthesis when CO2 is not saturating, as in C3 leaves in the present atmosphere. Little is known about the processes that determine the magnitude ofg m . The process dominatingg m is uncertain, though carbonic anhydrase, aquaporins, and the diffusivity of CO2 in water have all been suggested. The response ofg m to temperature (10°C–40°C) in mature leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv W38) was determined using measurements of leaf carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange, coupled with modulated chlorophyll fluorescence. These measurements revealed a temperature coefficient (Q10) of approximately 2.2 for g m , suggesting control by a protein-facilitated process because the Q10for diffusion of CO2 in water is about 1.25. Further,g m values are maximal at 35°C to 37.5°C, again suggesting a protein-facilitated process, but with a lower energy of deactivation than Rubisco. Using the temperature response of g m to calculate CO2 at Rubisco, the kinetic parameters of Rubisco were calculated in vivo from 10°C to 40°C. Using these parameters, we determined the limitation imposed on photosynthesis byg m . Despite an exponential rise with temperature, g m does not keep pace with increased capacity for CO2 uptake at the site of Rubisco. The fraction of the total limitations to CO2uptake within the leaf attributable tog m rose from 0.10 at 10°C to 0.22 at 40°C. This shows that transfer of CO2 from the intercellular air space to Rubisco is a very substantial limitation on photosynthesis, especially at high temperature.},

Concentrations of 0.3{\%} nitrogen and 0.01{\%} phosphorus in senesced leaves represent ultimate potential resorption of these nutrients in woody perennials. Resorption proficiency and potential resorption were quantitatively defined in two models that describe both resorption that is maximal and biochemically complete, and that which is not. Resorption is highly proficient in plants that have reduced nitrogen and phosphorus in their senescing leaves to concentrations below 0.7{\%} and 0.05{\%}, respectively. An important feature of knowing the levels to which nutrients can be reduced in senescing leaves is that these values offer an objective gauge by which to measure the success of resorption as a nutrient conservation mechanism. Evergreens were significantly more proficient at resorbing phosphorus than were deciduous species (0.045{\%} vs. 0.067{\%} P in senesced leaves, respectively) and plants capable of symbiotic nitrogen fixation were significantly less proficient at resorbing nitrogen than were nonfixers (1.6{\%} vs. 0.9{\%} N in senesced leaves, respectively). Resorption proficiency appeared to parallel som phylogenic trends, yet the influence of phylogeny was not so significant as to overwhelm the effects of recent selection. The ability of plants to reduce nitrogen in senescing leaves was significantly correlated with their ability to reduce phosphorus. Measurement and analysis of resorption proficiency, when coupled with concurrent consideration of potential resorption and resorption efficiency, should facilitate and expedite the ongoing attempt to resolve complex questions regarding the environmental constraints that influence resorption, and the selection pressures that have directed the evolution of this process.},

Our results showed that rank-order of the litter decomposition among the three forest stands was not parallel to the stand age. At 20A degrees C, the mass loss of A. obovata leaf litter from the primary forest was higher than those from the two secondary forests, of which the younger stand showed higher mass loss than did the older one. However, there were no differences in mass loss among these three stands at 30A degrees C. The mass loss for the two secondary forest stands, but not for the primary forest stand, increased significantly from 20 to 30A degrees C. The level of lignin decomposition among the three stands at 20A degrees C corresponded to their forest stand age, i.e., the primary forest {\textgreater} the 47-year-old secondary forest {\textgreater} the 35-year-old secondary forest. A rise of 10A degrees C in temperature significantly increased lignin decomposition for the two secondary forests, while the reverse was true for the primary forest. Carbohydrate decomposition was positively related to the temperature but not to the stand age. The different responses of litter decomposition to the forest stand age and temperature might be due to the differences in the microbial activities among the three forest stands.},

A variety of approaches have been developed to enumerate fish on videos, but to our knowledge these metrics have not been tested to determine if they are proportional to true abundance. We compared the most commonly used metric, MaxN (i.e., the maximum number of fish in a single frame during the viewing interval), to a newly developed metric, MeanCount (i.e., the mean number of fish observed in a series of snapshots over a viewing interval), using simulations, a laboratory experiment, and an empirical study. MaxN was nonlinearly related to true abundance using all three approaches, providing increasingly dampened estimates of abundance with increasing true abundance (i.e., hyperstability). Therefore, MaxN may result in positively biased indices of abundance for declining fish stocks or negatively biased abundance indices when fish stocks are increasing. Alternatively, MeanCount was generally linearly related to true abundance and its variability was similar to MaxN, suggesting that MeanCount can be useful for indexing abundance of fish in underwater video surveys.},

abstract = {Development and evaluation of noninvasive methods for monitoring species distribution and abundance is a growing area of ecological research. While noninvasive methods have the advantage of reduced risk of negative factors associated with capture, comparisons to methods using more traditional invasive sampling is lacking. Historically kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) occupied the desert and semi-arid regions of southwestern North America. Once the most abundant carnivore in the Great Basin Desert of Utah, the species is now considered rare. In recent decades, attempts have been made to model the environmental variables influencing kit fox distribution. Using noninvasive scat deposition surveys for determination of kit fox presence, we modeled resource selection functions to predict kit fox distribution using three popular techniques (Maxent, fixed-effects, and mixed-effects generalized linear models) and compared these with similar models developed from invasive sampling (telemetry locations from radio-collared foxes). Resource selection functions were developed using a combination of landscape variables including elevation, slope, aspect, vegetation height, and soil type. All models were tested against subsequent scat collections as a method of model validation. We demonstrate the importance of comparing multiple model types for development of resource selection functions used to predict a species distribution, and evaluating the importance of environmental variables on species distribution. All models we examined showed a large effect of elevation on kit fox presence, followed by slope and vegetation height. However, the invasive sampling method (i.e., radio-telemetry) appeared to be better at determining resource selection, and therefore may be more robust in predicting kit fox distribution. In contrast, the distribution maps created from the noninvasive sampling (i.e., scat transects) were significantly different than the invasive method, thus scat transects may be appropriate when used in an occupancy framework to predict species distribution. We concluded that while scat deposition transects may be useful for monitoring kit fox abundance and possibly occupancy, they do not appear to be appropriate for determining resource selection. On our study area, scat transects were biased to roadways, while data collected using radio-telemetry was dictated by movements of the kit foxes themselves. We recommend that future studies applying noninvasive scat sampling should consider a more robust random sampling design across the landscape (e.g., random transects or more complete road coverage) that would then provide a more accurate and unbiased depiction of resource selection useful to predict kit fox distribution.},

abstract = {This paper is designed to draw attention to the relation between tropical climatic uniformity at a given site and the effectiveness of topographic bar- riers adjacent to the site in preventing movements of plants and animals. This is not an attempt to explain tropical species diversity (see Pianka, 1966, for a review of this subject), but rather to discuss a factor that should be considered in any discussion of the relation between topographic and climatic diversity, and population isolation. Simpson (1964) states that "Small population ranges and numerous barriers against the spread and sym- patry of related populations would therefore tend to increase density of species in a region as a whole. It will be suggested below that this is a factor in the increase of species densities in regions of high topographic relief. I do not, however, know of any evidence that it is more general or more effective in the tropics." I believe that the climatic regimes discussed below, and the reactions of organisms to them, indicate that topographic barriers may be more effective in the tropics. Mountain barriers and their temperature gradients in Central America, as contrasted to those in North America, are used as examples; but it is believed that the central idea equally applies to other tropical areas, types of barriers, and physical parameters. There are three thoughts central to the argument to be developed: (1) in respect to temperature, it is the temperature gradient across a mountain range which determines its effectiveness as a barrier, rather than the abso- lute height; (2) in Central America, terrestrial temperature regimes are gen- erally more uniform than North American ones, and differ in their patterns of overlap across geographic barriers; and (3) it can be assumed that animals and plants are evolutionarily adapted to, and/or have the ability to acclimate to, the temperatures normally encountered in their temporal and geographic habitat (or microhabitat).

This study examines spatial patterns of above- and belowground C dynamics along a transect ranging from lowland Amazonia to the high Andes in SE Peru. Fine root biomass values increased from 1.50 Mg C ha-1 at 194 m to 4.95 +/- 0.62 Mg C ha-1 at 3020 m, reaching a maximum of 6.83 +/- 1.13 Mg C ha-1 at the 2020 m elevation site. Aboveground biomass values decreased from 123.50 Mg C ha-1 at 194 m to 47.03 Mg C ha-1 at 3020 m. Mean annual belowground productivity was highest in the most fertile lowland plots (7.40 +/- 1.00 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) and ranged between 3.43 +/- 0.73 and 1.48 +/- 0.40 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the premontane and montane plots. Mean annual aboveground productivity was estimated to vary between 9.50 +/- 1.08 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (210 m) and 2.59 +/- 0.40 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (2020 m), with consistently lower values observed in the cloud immersion zone of the montane forest. Fine root C residence time increased from 0.31 years in lowland Amazonia to 3.78 +/- 0.81 years at 3020 m and stem C residence time remained constant along the elevational transect, with a mean of 54 +/- 4 years. The ratio of fine root biomass to stem biomass increased significantly with increasing elevation, whereas the allocation of net primary productivity above- and belowground remained approximately constant at all elevations. Although net primary productivity declined in the TMF, the partitioning of productivity between the ecosystem subcomponents remained the same in lowland, premontane and montane forests.},

abstract = {Models of the geographic distributions of species have wide application in ecology. But the nonspatial, single-level, regression models that ecologists have often employed do not deal with problems of irregular sampling intensity or spatial dependence, and do not adequately quantify uncertainty. We show here how to build statistical models that can handle these features of spatial prediction and provide richer, more powerful inference about species niche relations, distributions, and the effects of human disturbance. We begin with a familiar generalized linear model and build in additional features, including spatial random effects and hierarchical levels. Since these models are fully specified statistical models, we show that it is possible to add complexity without sacrificing interpretability. This step-by-step approach, together with attached code that implements a simple, spatially explicit, regression model, is structured to facilitate self-teaching. All models are developed in a Bayesian framework. We assess the performance of the models by using them to predict the distributions of two plant species (Proteaceae) from South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We demonstrate that making distribution models spatially explicit can be essential for accurately characterizing the environmental response of species, predicting their probability of occurrence, and assessing uncertainty in the model results. Adding hierarchical levels to the models has further advantages in allowing human transformation of the landscape to be taken into account, as well as additional features of the sampling process.},

abstract = {Tropical forests contain an important proportion of the carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation, but estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests varies two-fold, with little consensus on the relative importance of climate, soil and forest structure in explaining spatial patterns. Here, we present analyses from a plot network designed to examine differences among contrasting forest habitats (terra firme, seasonally flooded, and white-sand forests) that span the gradient of climate and soil conditions of the Amazon basin.We installed 0.5-ha plots in 74 sites representing the three lowland forest habitats in both Loreto, Peru and French Guiana, and we integrated data describing climate, soil physical and chemical characteristics and stand variables, including local measures of wood specific gravity (WSG).We use a hierarchical model to separate the contributions of stand variables from climate and soil variables in explaining spatial variation in AGB. AGB differed among both habitats and regions, varying from 78Mgha?1 in white-sand forest in Peru to 605Mgha?1 in terra firme clay forest of French Guiana. Stand variables including tree size and basal area, and to a lesser extent WSG, were strong predictors of spatial variation in AGB. In contrast, soil and climate variables explained little overall variation in AGB, though they did co-vary to a limited extent with stand parameters that explained AGB. Our results suggest that positive feedbacks in forest structure and turnover controlAGB in Amazonian forests, with richer soils (Peruvian terra firme and all seasonally flooded habitats) supporting smaller trees with lower wood density and moderate soils (French Guianan terra firme) supporting many larger trees with high wood density. The weak direct relationships we observed between soil and climate variables and AGB suggest that the most appropriate approaches to landscape scale modeling of AGB in the Amazon would be based on remote sensing methods to map stand structure.},

abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category±subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to- individual ratios). Rarefaction methods ± both sample-based and individual-based ± allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

abstract = {Interpolation is a type of modeling that can be used to estimate habitat variables throughout a stream based on measurements distributed along the stream's length, but little guidance is available to select the best method of interpolation. Thus, we compared several methods to determine which produced the most accurate interpolation of width, depth, and current velocity, separately. We also determined whether interpolation should be performed using separate datasets for riffles, runs, and pools or unstratified datasets. We measured stream width, maximum depth, and mean current velocity in a northern Michigan watershed. We tested seven methods of interpolation including global average, linear regression, cubic spline, moving average, Lagrange polynomials, Kriging, and Loess smoother. Accuracy of different methods was determined by comparing interpolated habitat conditions to actual values measured at points along the river. This study produced two main recommendations. First, when performing interpolations, data should be stratified by meso-habitat type (riffles, runs, and pools) only when habitat variables are different for each meso-habitat type and stratification does not increase distance between points such that interpolation accuracy is reduced. If habitat variables are similar for all meso-habitat types, knowing the meso-habitat type within which a point falls does not add information that will increase interpolation accuracy. Second, the Loess smoother with a smoothing parameter from 0.2 to 0.4 generally produced the most accurate interpolated values and is the method we recommend for similar situations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

(2) Number of species increased during the early stages of succession, with stands twenty to forty years old having a species richness similar to that found in mature forests. (3) Basal area varied from 11 m2 ha-1 in a ten-year-old stand to 37 m2 ha-1 in a mature forest. (4) Allometric relationships between tree dimensions and tree weight were used to estimate biomass harvested in the field. (5) Dry weights are given for leaves, twigs, branches, stems and roots in successional and mature tierra firme forests. The biomass for each component for ten-year-old and mature forest stands, respectively, was 6-11 t ha-1 for leaves, 11-23 t ha-1 for twigs, 9-76 t ha-1 for branches, 18-145 t ha-1 for stems and 7-65 t ha-1 for roots. (6) Above-ground living biomass ranged from 44 t ha-1 for ten-year-old stand to 326 t ha-1 for mature forests. Dead biomass varied from 1 t ha-1 for twenty-year-old stands to 53 t ha-1 for a mature forest. (7) Above-ground living biomass increases linearly during the first forty years. No significant changes occur for the next forty years, because biomass accumulation is offset by the death of long-lived successional species. Approximately 190 years was the estimated time taken by a previously-cultivated site to reach mature forest basal area and biomass values.},

Location Ecological niche models were developed on the species' native distribu- tional area in South America, and projected globally. Methods We developed ecological niche models based on six different environ- mental data sets, and compared their respective abilities to anticipate the North American invasive distributional area of the species. Results We show that models based on the ‘bioclimatic variables' of the WorldClim data set indeed fail to predict the full invasive potential of the species, but that models based on four other data sets could predict this potential correctly. Main conclusions The difference in predictive abilities appears to centre on the complexity of the environmental variables involved. These results emphasize important influences of environmental data sets on the generality and ability of ecological niche models to anticipate novel phenomena, and offer a simpler explanation for the lack of predictive ability among native and invaded distributional areas than that of niche shifts.},

A number of studies have shown that the temperature sensitivity of litter decomposition can vary depending on litter type and extent of decomposition. However, the underlying causes of this variation are not well understood. According to fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics, the temperature sensitivity of microbial decomposition should be inversely related to litter carbon quality. We tested the accuracy of this hypothesis by adding ground plant shoot and root material to soils incubated under controlled conditions and measuring the temperature sensitivities of decomposition at three time points throughout a 53-d incubation. As the overall quality of the litter organic C declined, litter decomposition became more sensitive to temperature. This was true regardless of whether differences in C quality were due to inherent differences in litter chemistry or due to differences ...},

abstract = {Vascular epiphytes are a conspicuous and highly diverse group in tropical wet forests; yet, we understand little about their mineral nutrition across sites. In this study, we examined the mineral nutrition of three dominant vascular epiphyte groups: ferns, orchids, and bromeliads, and their host trees from samples collected along a 2600 m elevational gradient in the tropical wet forests of Costa Rica. We predicted that the mineral nutrition of ferns, orchids, and bromeliads would differ because of their putative differences in nutrient acquisition mechanisms and nutrient sources-atmospherically dependent, foliar feeding bromeliads would have lower nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations and more depleted delta(15)N values than those in canopy soil-rooted ferns because canopy soil is higher in available N, and more enriched in delta(15)N than the atmospheric sources of precipitation and throughfall. We also predicted that epiphyte foliar chemistry would mirror that of host trees because of the likely contribution of host trees to the nutrient cycle of epiphytes via foliar leaching and litter contributions to canopy soil. In the same vein, we predicted that epiphyte and host tree foliar chemistry would vary with elevation reflecting ecosystem-level nutrients-soil N availability increases and P availability decreases with increasing elevation. Our results confirmed that canopy soil-rooted epiphytes had higher N concentrations than atmospheric epiphytes; however, our predictions were not confirmed with respect to P which did not vary among groups indicating fixed P availability within sites. In addition, foliar delta(15)N values did not match our prediction in that canopy soil-rooted as well as atmospheric epiphytes had variable signatures. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) on foliar measurements determined that ferns, orchids, and bromeliads are statistically distinct in mineral nutrition. We also found that P concentrations of ferns and orchids, but not bromeliads, were significantly correlated with those of host trees indicating a possible link in their mineral nutrition's via canopy soil. Interestingly, we did not find any patterns of epiphyte foliar chemistry with elevation. These data indicate that the mineral nutrition of the studied epiphyte groups are distinct and highly variable within sites and the diverse uptake mechanisms of these epiphyte groups enhance resource partitioning which may be a mechanism for species richness maintenance in tropical forest canopies.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition in the tropics is predicted to increase drastically in the next decades. The sparse information on N cycling in tropical forests revealed that the soil N status of an ecosystem is the key to analyze its reactions to projected increase in N input. Our study was aimed at (1) comparing the soil N availability of forest sites across an Ecuadorian Andosol toposequence by quantifying gross rates of soil N cycling in situ, and (2) determining the factors controlling the differences in soil N cycling across sites. The toposequence was represented by five old-growth forest sites with elevations ranging from 300m to 1500m. Our results provide general insights into the role of elevation-mediated factors (i.e. degree of soil development and temperature) in driving patterns of soil N cycling. Gross rates of N transformations, microbial N turnover time, and $\delta$15N signatures in soil and leaf litter decreased with increasing elevation, signifying a decreasing N availability across the toposequence. This was paralleled by a decreasing degree of soil development with increasing elevation, as indicated by declining clay contents, total C, total N, effective cation exchange capacity and increasing base saturation. Soil N-cycling rates and $\delta$15N signatures were highly correlated with mean annual temperature but not with mean annual rainfall and soil moisture which did not systematically vary across the toposequence. Microbial immobilization was the largest fate of produced NH4+ across all sites, and nitrification activity was only 5–11{\%} of gross NH4+ production. We observed a fast reaction of NO3− to organic N and its role for N retention deserves further attention. If projected increase in N deposition will occur, the timing and magnitude of gaseous N losses may follow the pattern of N availability across this Andosol toposequence.},

abstract = {This paper studies changes of 15N signatures ($\delta$15N, ‰) and total N (TN, {\%}) in soil profiles among forest stands with different losses within the same climatic zone. An additional aim was to investigate whether the change of $\delta$15N ($\Delta$$\delta$15N) within the 0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm depths of the mineral layer could be linked to measured potential net N mineralization rates. Soil samples were collected from five forest stands in Belgium: three mixed deciduous forests (G, AE, LD), a homogenous deciduous (SB) and a coniferous stand (CP). At the G site, five locations were sampled: one at the forest edge (GE), two deeper in the forest (GF1, GF2), one clear-cut spot (GO) and one in coppice wood (GC). The $\delta$15N and TN measurements were conducted for the litter layer, the fermentation + humus layer and the underlying mineral layers (0–30 cm, at 2 cm inter- vals). The $\delta$15N values increased with depth, ranging from –12‰ to –1‰ for the forest floor and from –7‰ to +15‰ for the mineral layers. The overall enrichment factor was greater for locations GE, AE and SB (–5.2‰, P {\textless}0.001, R2 =0.86) than locations GF1, GF2, GO, GC, LD and CP (–2.4‰, P {\textless}0.001, R2 =0.93), possibly indi- cating NO3– losses. A significant linear regression model could be calculated between $\Delta$$\delta$15N and potential net N mineralization rates (y =0.04x), explaining 65{\%} of the variability of $\Delta$$\delta$15N. Thus, $\delta$15N profiles in forest soils might be useful as an indicator of loss and N miner- alization behaviour, however, further research is needed to confirm our observations.},

They have also been used to monitor the fate of bycatch discards and other food falls, and to help measure metabolic rates, swimming speed and foraging behaviour of abyssal scavengers. This paper gives a brief overview of the general methodology, benefits and limitations of the technique. We conclude that baited video techniques afford the only sampling option for some situations, but more often can complement other traditional methods to enhance the scope and capability of monitoring and stock assessment programs. Major advances will be made when models are developed for shallow waters to estimate absolute density of target species by accounting for the sampling area in the bait plume. Cheaper, better and smaller camera, lighting and deployment systems are inevitable, but focussed research and development is needed to overcome bottlenecks in data acquisition from tapes through incremental automation.},

Acknowledging their variability and evolution has allowed us to understand how species adapt in response to their environment. The same traits are also involved in how species alter ecosystems and shape their dynamics and functioning. Some theories, such as the metabolic theory of ecology, ecological stoichiometry or pace-of-life theory, already recognize this junction, but only do so in an implicitly non-spatial context. Meanwhile, for a decade now, it has been argued that ecosystem properties have to be understood at a larger scale using meta-ecosystem theory because source-sink dynamics, community assembly and ecosystem stability are all modified by spatial structure. Here, we argue that some ecosystem properties can be linked to a single life-history trait, dispersal, i.e. the tendency of organisms to live, compete and reproduce away from their birth place. By articulating recent theoretical and empirical studies linking ecosystem functioning and dynamics to species dispersal, we aim to highlight both the known connections between life-history traits and ecosystem properties and the unknown areas, which deserve further empirical and theoretical developments.},

Knowledge and understanding of the species' interactions with the environment and with native fish are important to stop and prevent the further spread of the species. Creating species distribution models is a useful technique to determine which factors influence the occurrence and abundance of a species. We applied three different modelling techniques: gen- eral additive models, random forests and fuzzy habitat suitability modelling (FHSM) to assess the habitat suitability of topmouth gudgeon. The former two techniques indicated that the abundance of native fish (i.e. biotic variables)was more important than environ- mental variables when determining the abundance of topmouth gudgeon in Flanders (Belgium). Bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), stone loach (Barbatula barbatula), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)and predator abundance were selected as themost important biotic variables and implemented in the FHSM to investigate species interactions. Depending on the preferred food source and spawning behaviour, either coexistence or interspecific competition can occur with bitterling, stone loach and three-spined stickleback. In contrast, the presence of predators clearly had a top down effect on topmouth gudgeon abundance. These findingscouldbeappliedas a biological controlmeasure and implemented in conservation strategies in order to reduce the abundance of earlier established populations of topmouth gudgeon},

Carbon stocks in live aboveground and belowground biomass, necromass, and soils were measured in a heterogeneous landscape composed of secondary and primary forest.

Local biomass equations were developed and used to estimate aboveground biomass and coarse root biomass for each plot. Herbaceous vegetation, fine roots, coarse and fine litter, and soil carbon to 4 m depth were measured in subplots. In primary forests, mean total carbon stocks (TCS) were estimated as 383.7 ?? 55.5 Mg C ha-1 (??S.E.). Of this amount, soil organic carbon to 4 m depth represented 59{\%}, total aboveground biomass 29{\%}, total belowground biomass 10{\%}, and necromass 2{\%}.

Of the total uncertainty of the estimates of TCS, the variation associated with the spatial variation of C pools between plots was higher than measurement errors within plots. From this study it is concluded that estimates of aboveground biomass largely underestimate total carbon stocks in forest ecosystems. Additionally, it is suggested that heterogeneous landscapes impose additional challenges for their study such as sampling intensity. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is increasingly used to study a wide variety of complex Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM) processes, such as water flow and turbulent mixing of contaminants in rivers and estuaries and wind flow and air pollution dispersion in urban areas. However, the accuracy and reliability of CFD modeling and the correct use of CFD results can easily be compromised. In 2006, Jakeman et al. set out ten iterative steps of good disciplined model practice to develop purposeful, credible models from data and a priori knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision (Jakeman et al., 2006). This paper discusses the application of the ten-steps approach to CFD for EFM in three parts. In the first part, the existing best practice guidelines for CFD applications in this area are reviewed and positioned in the ten-steps framework. The second and third part present a retrospective analysis of two case studies in the light of the ten-steps approach: (1) contaminant dispersion due to transverse turbulent mixing in a shallow water flow and (2) coupled urban wind flow and indoor natural ventilation of the Amsterdam ArenA football stadium. It is shown that the existing best practice guidelines for CFD mainly focus on the last steps in the ten-steps framework. The reasons for this focus are outlined and the value of the additional - preceding - steps is discussed. The retrospective analysis of the case studies indicates that the ten-steps approach is very well applicable to CFD for EFM and that it provides a comprehensive framework that encompasses and extends the existing best practice guidelines. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where the imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large consequences for the global carbon cycle. However, considerable uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and prior land use. Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests. Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to 90{\%} of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years varied 11.3-fold (from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland areas with high biomass resilience.},

abstract = {ecently, we have gained the opportunity to obtain very high-resolution imagery and topographic data of rivers using drones and novel digital photogrammetric processing techniques. The high-resolution outputs from this method are unprecedented, and provide the opportunity to move beyond river habitat classification systems, and work directly with spatially explicit continuums of data. Traditionally, classification systems have formed the backbone of physical river habitat monitoring for their ease of use, rapidity, cost efficiency, and direct comparability. Yet such classifications fail to characterize the detailed heterogeneity of habitat, especially those features which are small or marginal. Drones and digital photogrammetry now provide an alternative approach for monitoring river habitat and hydromorphology, which we review here using two case studies. First, we demonstrate the classification of river habitat using drone imagery acquired in 2012 of a 120 m section of the San Pedro River in Chile, which was at the technological limits of what could be achieved at that time. Second, we review how continuums of data can be acquired, using drone imagery acquired in 2016 from the River Teme in Herefordshire, England. We investigate the precision and accuracy of these data continuums, highlight key current challenges, and review current best practices of data collection, processing, and management. We encourage further quantitative testing and field applications. If current difficulties can be overcome, these continuums of geomorphic and hydraulic information hold great potential for providing new opportunities for understanding river systems to the benefit of both river science and management.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that increases in temperature can accelerate the decomposition of organic carbon contained in forest mineral soil (Cs), and, therefore, that global warming should increase the release of soil organic carbon to the atmosphere. These predictions assume, however, that decay constants can be accurately derived from short-term laboratory incubations of soil or that in situ incubations of fresh litter accurately represent the temperature sensitivity of Cs decomposition. But our limited understanding of the biophysical factors that control Cs decomposition rates, and observations of only minor increases in Cs decomposition rate with temperature in longer-term forest soil heating experiments and in latitudinal comparisons of Cs decomposition rates bring these predictions into question. Here we have compiled Cs decomposition data from 82 sites on five continents. We found that Cs decomposition rates were remarkably constant across a global-scale gradient in mean annual temperature. These data suggest that Cs decomposition rates for forest soils are not controlled by temperature limitations to microbial activity, and that increased temperature alone will not stimulate the decomposition of forest-derived carbon in mineral soil.},

abstract = {Remotely sensed datasets are increasingly being used to model habitat suitability for a variety of taxa. We review habitat suitability models (HSMs) developed for both plants and animals that include remote sensing predictor variables to determine how these variables could affect model projections. For models focused on plant species habitat, we find several instances of unintentional bias in HSMs of vegetation due to the inclusion of remote sensing variables. Notably, studies that include continuous remote sensing variables could be inadvertently mapping actual species distribution instead of potential habitat due to unique spectral or temporal characteristics of the target species. Additionally, HSMs including categorical classifications are rarely explicit about assumptions of habitat suitability related to land cover, which could lead to unintended exclusion of potential habitat due to current land use. Although we support the broader application of remote sensing in general, we caution developers of HSMs to be aware of introduced model bias. These biases are more likely to arise when remote sensing variables are added to models simply because they improve accuracy, rather than considering how they affect the model results and interpretation. When including land cover classifications as predictors, we recommend that modellers provide more explicit descriptions of how habitat is defined (e.g., is deforested land considered suitable for trees?). Further, we suggest that continuous remote sensing variables should only be included in habitat models if authors can demonstrate that their inclusion characterizes potential habitat rather than actual species distribution. Use of the term 'habitat suitability model' rather than 'species distribution model' could reduce confusion about modelling goals and improve communication between the remote sensing and ecological modelling communities. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

Starting from the stated model purpose, a weighted dimensionless cost function is set up that attributes equal weight to the vertical and the horizontal tide. By adapting the bottom roughness, the cost function is minimized during model calibration. Quantification of the model skill and cost function calculation is done using the VIMM toolbox which is developed and maintained at Flanders Hydraulics Research. The quantified model skill of the SCALDIS model shows that the model is well suited to assess the effects of changing the bathymetry and geometry of the Scheldt river on water levels, velocities, tracer dispersion and residence times, and that the hydrodynamics can be used as the basis for sediment transport calculations (both cohesive and non-cohesive).},

They were analysed for total and exchangeable cations, C, N, pH with various P fractions also determined. Physical properties were also examined and an index of soil physical quality proposed. A diverse range of soils was found. For the western areas near the Andean cordillera and the southern and northern fringes, soils tend to be distributed among the lower pedogenetic levels, while the central and eastern areas of Amazonia have more intensely weathered soils. This gives rise to a large variation of soil chemical and physical properties across the Basin, with soil properties varying predictably along a gradient of pedogenic development. Nutrient pools generally increased slightly in concentration from the youngest to the intermediate aged soils after which a gradual decline was observed with the lowest values found in the most weathered soils. Soil physical properties were strongly correlated with soil fertility, with favourable physical properties occurring in highly weathered and nutrient depleted soils and with the least weathered, more fertile soils having higher incidence of limiting physical properties. Soil phosphorus concentrations varied markedly in accordance with weathering extent and appear to exert an important influence on the nitrogen cycle of Amazon forest soils},

abstract = {Environmental change is expected to shift the geographic range of species and communities. To estimate the consequences of these shifts for the functioning and stability of ecosystems, reliable predictions of alterations in species distributions are needed. Projections with correlative species distribution models, which correlate species' distributions to the abiotic environment, have become a standard approach. Criticism of this approach centres around the omission of relevant biotic feedbacks and triggered the search for alternatives. A new generation of mechanistic process-based species distribution models aims at implementing formulations of relevant biotic processes to cover species' life histories, physiology, dispersal abilities, evolution, and both intra- and interspecific interactions. Although this step towards more structural realism is considered important, it remains unclear whether the resulting projections are more reliable. Structural realism has the advantage that geographic range shifting emerges from the interplay of relevant abiotic and biotic processes. Having implemented the relevant response mechanisms, structural realistic models should better tackle the challenge of generating projections of species responses to (non-analogous) environmental change. However, reliable projections of future species ranges demand ecological information that is currently only available for few species. In this opinion paper, we discuss how the discrepancy between demand for structural realism on the one hand and the related knowledge gaps on the other hand affects the reliability of mechanistic species distribution models. We argue that omission of relevant processes potentially impairs projection accuracy (proximity of the mean outcome to the true value), particularly if species range shifts emerge from species and community dynamics. Yet, insufficient knowledge that limits model specification and parameterization, as well as process complexity, increases projection uncertainty (variance in the outcome of simulated model projections). The accuracy-uncertainty-relation reflects current limits to delivering reliable projections of range shifts. We propose a protocol to improve and communicate projection reliability. The protocol combines modelling and empirical research to efficiently fill critical knowledge gaps that currently limit the reliability of species and community projections.},

Observations on the conditions, particularly floods and the phase$\backslash$nof the moon, which affect the seaward migration of silver eels were$\backslash$ncollected for three years from six field sites in the English Lake$\backslash$nDistrict. 2. These observations confirmed that silver eel runs occur$\backslash$nonly between late summer and early winter. The higher upstream the$\backslash$neels the earlier in the season they are trapped. 3. The migration$\backslash$nwas confined to very few nights, on which large numbers of silver$\backslash$neels travelled seawards; eels ran on the same nights at widely separated$\backslash$nsites. 4. Most eels migrated when floods coincided with moonless$\backslash$nperiods. Few eels ran when there was a full moon; the run could be$\backslash$nchecked experimentally by artificial light. The start of the eel$\backslash$nseason was delayed until there was a flood, after which some eels$\backslash$nran on dark nights when there was no flood. The greatest catches$\backslash$nwere made on rising floods. Weather conditions were not as important$\backslash$nas floods in determining whether eel runs occurred. 5. Eels tended$\backslash$nto run in the early hours of the night except on a rising flood.$\backslash$nEvidence whether eels congregate near a lake outflow before migrating$\backslash$ndownstream was inconclusive. 6. Attempts to induce runs of eels and$\backslash$nto re-trap marked eels were not very successful, but both contributed$\backslash$nevidence that silver eels have to be stimulated into a `migration$\backslash$nmood', a state of extreme activity, before they will migrate. This$\backslash$nmood appeared to be related to conditions of flood, possibly fall$\backslash$nin temperature and darkness of the night. Eels kept in tanks in the$\backslash$nlaboratory were particularly active the same nights that eels were$\backslash$nmigrating in the field. 7. Experiments in the field and laboratory$\backslash$nhave shown that the downstream migration of silver eels may be (a)$\backslash$nchecked, and (b) deflected by lights. At Cunsey Beck a series of$\backslash$nunderwater lights stopped the run of eels for half-hour periods.$\backslash$nFor the deflexion of eels into traps at the side of a river underwater$\backslash$nlights must be thrown well upstream; lights shining vertically downward$\backslash$ninto the water are less effective. Upstream-shining lights of about$\backslash$n5 and 0.7 c.p. were effective in Cunsey Beck; evidence whether brighter$\backslash$nlights would deflect more eels is conflicting. The extreme activity$\backslash$nof the silver eel associated with migration appears to lower the$\backslash$nthreshold of response to light, artificial lights having most effect$\backslash$non the nights when the eels were most active. There is no reason$\backslash$nto believe that the response to light differs according to the sex$\backslash$nof the eel. 8. In an artificial river in the laboratory the downstream$\backslash$nswim was delayed by light and eels chose a dark channel in preference$\backslash$nto a lit one; there was evidence from laboratory experiments that$\backslash$nonce the shock effect of the light wore off the eels responded photokinetically$\backslash$ninstead of negatively phototactically. 9. In the artificial river$\backslash$nthe eels swam upstream against a flow of 1.1 ft./sec., but tired$\backslash$nrapidly against a current of 1.7 ft./sec. 10. It was concluded that$\backslash$nflood, or some associated factor, possibly fall in water temperature,$\backslash$nacts as a trigger stimulus starting the downstream migration. Eels$\backslash$nthen run continuously, except when inhibited by light during the$\backslash$nday and on nights with bright moonlight or starlight, until the effect$\backslash$nof the activating stimulus wears off.

abstract = {Tropical rain forests decrease in tree height and aboveground biomass (AGB) with increasing elevation. The causes of this phenomenon remain insufficiently understood despite a number of explanations proposed including direct or indirect effects of low temperature on carbon acquisition and carbon investment, adverse soil conditions and impaired nutrient supply. For analysing altitudinal patterns of aboveground/belowground carbon partitioning, we measured fine ({\textless}2 mm in diameter) and coarse root (2-5 mm) biomass and necromass and leaf area index (LAI), and estimated AGB from stand structural parameters in five tropical mountain rain forests at 1050, 1540, 1890, 2380 and 3060 m along an altitudinal transect in the South Ecuadorian Andes. Average tree height and AGB were reduced to less than 50{\%} between 1050 and 3060 m, LAI decreased from 5.1 to 2.9. The leaf area reduction must have resulted in a lowered canopy carbon gain and thus may partly explain the reduced tree growth in the high-elevation stands. In contrast, both fine and coarse root biomass significantly increased with elevation across this transect. The ratio of root biomass (fine and coarse) to AGB increased more than ten-fold from 0.04 at 1050 m to 0.43 at 3060 m. Under the assumption that fine root biomass does reflect root productivity, our data indicate a marked belowground shift in C allocation with increasing elevation. Possible explanations for this allocation shift are discussed including reduced N supply due to low temperatures, water logging or adverse soil chemical conditions. We conclude that the fine root system and its activity may hold the key for understanding the impressive reduction in tree size along tropical mountain slopes in Ecuador. Analyses of fine root turnover and longevity in relation to environmental factors along altitudinal transects in tropical mountains are urgently needed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {A detailed quantitative description is given of the tree flora of thirty-eight square plots of 10 × 10 m in four forest-types at c. 1550 m altitude on the ridge between John Crow Peak and Morce's Gap in the Blue Mountains in Jamaica. The four forest-types (Mor Ridge, Mull Ridge, Wet Slope and Gap) can be assigned to three associations: the Chaetocarpus globosus--Clusia cf. havetioides--Lyonia cf. octandra association (Mor Ridge), the Dendropanax pendulus-Hedyosmum arborescens-Podocarpus urbanii association (Mull Ridge and Wet Slope) and the Cyathea pubescens--Meriania purpurea--Solanum punctulatum association (Gap). The two Ridge forests have a higher basal area and more individuals per unit area than the Gap and Wet Slope forests. The distributions of individuals in girth size-classes show that most species are regenerating. The level of competition appears to fall in the sequence Gap {\textgreater} Mull Ridge {\textgreater} Mor Ridge and to be greater in Gap forest than Wet Slope forest. The amount of organic matter in the soil decreases in the series Mor Ridge {\textgreater} Mull Ridge {\textgreater} Gap {\textgreater} Wet Slope. In a mineralization test moderate quantities of nitrate were released in all soils except that of the Wet Slope forest. In a series of bioassays several species were found to fail completely on Mor Ridge forest soil. Two species showed a primary limitation by phosphorus on the other three soils, and one accumulated nitrogen to high levels. Holcus lanatus on soil from Mor Ridge forest showed a significant response to phosphate fertilizers but only after the pH was raised. Mean foliar levels of N, P, K and Ca increase along the sequence Mor Ridge, Mull Ridge-cum-West Slope, Gap. In contrast, the foliar levels in single species do not differ between forest-types except for K and Mg; the K level is markedly lower in Mor Ridge forest. It is tentatively suggested that the Mor Ridge forest is limited primarily by the extremely low soil pH (2.8-3.5), that the Mull Ridge forest is limited relative to the Gap forest by a slower circulation of nutrients, and that the Wet Slope forest is limited relative to Mull Ridge forest by the lack of support provided by the very shallow soil ( {\$}\backslashgeqslantless 30{\$} cm deep) and the difficulty of establishment on a 30°-slope. Comparisons between the Jamaican forests and Lower Montane Rain forests in Puerto Rico and New Guinea show that the Jamaican forest soils are all low in total carbon (except Mor Ridge soil), total nitrogen and instantaneously exchangeable bases. Comparison of mean foliar mineral levels between the most widespread Jamaican forest-type (Mull Ridge-cum-Wet Slope) and a much taller Lower Montane Rain forest in New Guinea suggests that the Jamaican forest is not short of N, P, K or Ca, but it is emphasized that more critical studies on mineral cycling are needed to explore this question.},

abstract = {The slenderness coefficients of trees, defined as the ratio of total height to diameter at 1.3m above ground, have been widely used as an index of the resistance of trees to windthrow. For many European coniferous species, slenderness coefficients have been intensively studied, but very little information is available for the tree species in boreal mixedwoods of Canada. By applying correlation analysis and graphical approaches to permanent sample plots data from Alberta, the relationships between slenderness coefficients and tree or stand variables were investigated for the five major species in boreal mixedwoods. Tree slenderness coefficients were found to be negatively correlated with tree diameter at breast height (DBH), height, crown length and age, but positively correlated with stand density level, species composition, and site index values. For three coniferous species, the results were consistent with those found for European coniferous species in literature. However, for the two deciduous species...},

abstract = {The spruce-fir [Picea rubens Sarg.-Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir.] forests of the southern Appalachian Mountains are considered refugial, endangered communities that exist on only seven mountaintop areas in Virginia and North Carolina, USA. These relict forests continue to be threatened by stress factors such as logging, acid rain deposition, attacks from invasive insects, and climate change. It has been suggested that these communities have persisted because of frequent cloudiness and periods of cloud immersion (fog), although few studies have examined corresponding effects on microclimate and tree ecophysiology. Incident sunlight (PPFD), air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and xylem water potentials were measured throughout the summer growing season in Mount Mitchell State Park, NC (35°45'53'N, 82°15'54'W), along with continuous camera recordings of the forest canopy and accompanying cloud conditions. Approximately 60{\%} of all summer days had at least 2h of cloud immersion with the large majority (80.3{\%}) of immersion events occurring during morning hours. Cloud-immersed days had the greatest reduction in cumulative daily PPFD compared to clear days (11.09molm

Moreover, xylem water potential ($\Psi$) increased significantly (∼0.2MPa; values) from morning to afternoon on cloud-immersed days. In contrast, clear days showed no afternoon recovery in $\Psi$, but a continued decrease during the afternoon. Juvenile $\Psi$ was more responsive to daily cloud regime compared to adult $\Psi$ and had a strong negative correlation with vapor pressure deficit. When all measurement days were sorted by the cloud pattern of the previous day, there was a strong response in juveniles trees, i.e. $\Psi$ increased following previous afternoon cloud-immersion. Juveniles of both species also had greater seasonal decreases in $\Psi$ than adults (P. rubens, adult: 0.05MPa, juvenile: 0.13MPa; A. fraseri, adult: 0.06MPa, juvenile: 0.20Mpa). For climate change models that predict a higher cloud base (resulting in less immersion) and dryer conditions, the water relations of Abies fraseri and Picea rubens could be substantially and negatively influenced. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This review is based on 58 climate-fisheries models published over the last 28 years that describe the impacts of fishery pressure and environmental variability on populations and ecosystems and include basic principles of population dynamics. It points out that the incorporation of environmental factors in fishery models has already been done and is of great importance for future models used in the assessment of marine resources. The work is guided by the questions to what extent have these models a) enhanced our understanding of the interrelationships between the environment, the fishery and the state of the exploited resources and b) helped to improve the prediction of population dynamics and the assessment of marine resources. For each of the six most commonly used model categories a case study is critically analyzed. The problems of "breaking relationships" between environmental factors and the biological response used in models, the trade-off between model complexity (realism) and simplicity (data availability) and the potential of multivariate climate indices for forecasting ecosystem states and for use as proxies for combined models are discussed, as are novel non-linear and spatially explicit modeling approaches. Approaches differ in terms of model complexity, use of linear or non-linear equations, number of parameters, forecast time horizon and type of resource modelled. A majority of the models were constructed for fish and invertebrate stocks of the northeast Pacific and the epicontinental seas of the Atlantic, reflecting the advancement of fisheries science in these regions. New, in parts highly complex models and sophisticated approaches were identified. The reviewed studies demonstrate that the performance of fished stocks can better be described if environmental or climatic variability is incorporated into the fisheries models. We conclude that due to the already available knowledge, the greatly enhanced computer power, new methods and recent findings of large-scale climatic/oceanographic cycles, fisheries modeling should progress greatly in the coming years.},

abstract = {We measured CO2 efflux from stems of seven subtropical tree species situated along an elevational gradient in the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico and scaled these measurements up to the landscape level based on modeled and empirical relations. The most important determinants of ecosystem stem respiration were species composition and stem temperature. At a species scale, measured CO2 efflux per unit bole surface area at a given temperature was highest in the early successional species Cecropia schreberiana and lowest in species that inhabit high elevations such as Micropholis garciniifolia and Tabebuia rigida. Carbon dioxide efflux rates followed a diel pattern that lagged approximately 6 h behind changes in sapwood temperatures. At an ecosystem scale, our simulation model indicates a decreasing trend of stem respiration rates with increasing elevation due to shifts in species composition, lower temperatures and reductions in branch surface area. The highest estimated stem respiration rates were present in the lowland tabonuco forest type and the lowest rates were present in the elfin forest type (mean 7.4 and 2.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, respectively). There was slight temperature-induced seasonal variation in simulated stem respiration rates at low elevations, with a maximum difference of 19{\%} between the months of February and July.

However, an accurate description of species' geographic ranges as a function of the environment requires that species observations and climatic variables are measured at the same spatial and temporal resolution, which is usually not the case. Weather station data are interpolated and these resulting continuous data layers are incorporated into SDMs, often without any uncertainty assessment. Here we quantify the effects of three unrelated but complementary aspects of uncertainty in weather station interpolations on SDM performance using MaxEnt. We examine the influence of topographic heterogeneity, interannual variability, and distance to station on the over- and under-prediction of modeled North American bird distributions. Ou...},

abstract = {The Great Bay Estuarine System, in New Hampshire, USA, has been the focus area for an attempt to develop a robust finite element method model for estuarine hydrodynamics. Past studies used a nonlinear, time stepping, kinematic model with limited success (Ip et al. Advances in fluid mechanics III, WIT, Southampton (2000) 569; Bilgili et al. J. Geophys. Res. - Oceans 107 (2002); Ert??rk et al. Estuar. Coast. Shelf Sci. 47 (1998) 119). We add dynamic physics (that is, local accelerations) for deep-water areas and keep kinematic physics (that is, without local and advective accelerations), with the inclusion of a porous medium beneath the open channel, for shallow and dewatering areas. The choice of which physics set to apply is made on an elemental depth dependent basis. The addition of the local acceleration terms for deep-water areas is seen to greatly improve accuracy in matching of tidal phasing over previous studies. Simulations involving M2/M4/M6 tidal constituents result in strong agreement to observed data from the 1975 Great Bay field program (Swift {\&} Brown, Estuar. Coast. Shelf Sci. 17 (1983) 297), in terms of both tidal heights and cross-section averaged velocities. Comparisons with 10 tidal elevation observation stations and four cross-section averaged current transects show good agreement, displaying average normalized root mean square misfit values of 0.08 and 0.25, respectively. Study of the simulated momentum balance shows the size of the contributions from acceleration terms to be on the order of a third the size of the contributions from the pressure gradient and bottom stress terms. Although relatively small, they are observed to peak at the crucial time of tidal reversal. Application of the model for long-term simulation using an M2/N2/S2 forcing shows the ability to realistically capture the spring-neap cycle. The tidally rectified flow is generally described as a constant spatial pattern with overall amplitude modulation following the spring-neap cycle. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Because all microclimatic variables change with elevation, it is difficult to compare plant performance and especially photosynthetic capacity at different elevations. Indeed, most previous studies investigated photosynthetic capacity of low- and high-elevation plants using constant temperature, humidity and light but varying CO2 partial pressures (P CO2). Using gas exchange measurements, we compared here maximum assimilation rates (A max) at ambient and constant-low-elevation P CO2 for two temperate tree species along an altitudinal gradient (100 to 1600 m) in the Pyrenees mountains. Significant differences in A max were observed between the CO2 partial pressure treatments for elevations above 600 m, the between-treatment differences increasing with elevation up to 4 mol m-2 s-1. We found an increase in A max with increasing elevation at constant-low-elevation P CO2 but not at ambient P CO2 for both species. Given a 10{\%} change in P CO2, a proportionally higher shift in maximum assimilation rate was found for both species. Our results showed that high elevation populations had higher photosynthetic capacity and therefore demonstrated that trees coped with extreme environmental conditions by a combination of adaptation (genetic evolution) and of acclimation. Our study also highlighted the importance of using constant CO2 partial pressure to assess plant adaptation at different elevations.},

abstract = {Wood density is a crucial variable in carbon accounting programs of both secondary and old-growth tropical forests. It also is the best single descriptor of wood: it correlates with numerous morphological, mechanical, physiological, and ecological properties. To explore the extent to which wood density could be estimated for rare or poorly censused taxa, and possible sources of variation in this trait, we analyzed regional, taxonomic, and phylogenetic variation in wood density among 2456 tree species from Central and South America. Wood density varied over more than one order of magnitude across species, with an overall mean of 0.645 g/cm(3). Our geographical analysis showed significant decreases in wood density with increasing altitude and significant differences among low-altitude geographical regions: wet forests of Central America and western Amazonia have significantly lower mean wood density than dry forests of Central and South America, eastern and central Amazonian forests, and the Atlantic forests of Brazil; and eastern Amazonian forests have lower wood densities than the dry forests and the Atlantic forest. A nested analysis of variance showed that 74{\%} of the species-level wood density variation was explained at the genus level, 34{\%} at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) family level, and 19{\%} at the APG order level. This indicates that genus-level means give reliable approximations of values of species, except in a few hypervariable genera. We also studied which evolutionary shifts in wood density occurred in the phylogeny of seed plants using a composite phylogenetic tree. Major changes were observed at deep nodes (Eurosid 1), and also in more recent divergences (for instance in the Rhamnoids, Simaroubaceae, and Anacardiaceae). Our unprecedented wood density data set yields consistent guidelines for estimating wood densities when species-level information is lacking and should significantly reduce error in Central and South American carbon accounting programs.},

abstract = {The present study focuses on the use of diver-operated video (DOV) as a tool to evaluate the impact of a marine reserve on a fish assemblage, in comparison to underwater visual census (UVC). Samplings were conducted in the vicinity of the marine protected area (MPA) Cerb{\`{e}}re-Banyuls (northwestern Mediterranean Sea). Four sites, with different levels of protection, were sampled 4 times, at depths of 5 and 10 m, to study abundance, species richness, structure of fish assemblages and fish aggregation. Results obtained by DOV and UVC provided evidence of significant effects of protection on abundance, species richness and fish assemblages. However, detection of weaker reserve effects using DOV may be limited. Furthermore, certain species are difficult to identify by video (e.g. Symphodus spp.), but DOV may be useful when studying a target and/or easily identifiable species. Contrary to UVC, DOV data can be archived and used for further study. Results concerning fish aggregation within fish assemblages showed specific patterns. Sites outside the MPA were mainly characterized by the absence of fish or few fish aggregations, and sites inside were characterized by high fish density (i.e. dispersed or patched aggregations). Thus, the fish aggregation parameter measured using DOV is an interesting metric to quantify reserve effect. Consequently, although this technique is time-consuming to produce results, DOV presents great potential for estimating MPA effectiveness while allowing simultaneous work on several sites to limit temporal bias. },

abstract = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A field comparison of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) and prawn (shrimp) trawls was made to assess the sampling options for describing patterns of fish biodiversity in the lagoonal waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Replicated comparisons were made during the day and night on trawl grounds with different biophysical characteristics. Each trawl was made close and parallel to a long-shore set of five BRUVS set at regular intervals along one nautical mile. For each species, the sum of the maximum number of fish sighted on BRUVS at any one time (???MaxN1, ..., 5) was compared with the number of fish caught in trawls (N). The two techniques recorded significantly different components of the fish fauna on the trawl grounds. Trawls caught mainly small (???300 mm), sedentary or cryptic, demersal species - such as flatfishes, apogonids, synodontids, triglids and callionymids. The BRUVS recorded more larger, mobile species from a much wider size range of families, including large elasmobranchs, more fusiform pelagic species (such as carangids and scombrids), and numerous eels. Species accumulation curves were parallel and very similar in shape for both techniques, but were separated by about 11 extra species in trawls. Fifty-two species in 17 families were caught only in trawls and 38 species in 15 families were recorded only by BRUVS. The occurrence of 38 small mobile species in 21 families was common to both techniques, but most of these showed marked differences in relative abundance. Trawls recorded higher species richness at all sites, and at night, but the average number of species and individuals recorded per transect were only about 26{\%} and 19{\%} lower for the BRUVS. The BRUVS consistently recorded more species during the day than trawls, and are limited most by water clarity. Multivariate analyses showed that both techniques indicated the presence of six fish assemblages based on day and night in three locations, despite sampling quite different components of the fauna. The six assemblages accounted for 78.9{\%} of the variation in the BRUVS data compared to 68.9{\%} of the variation in the trawl data, and there was a lower error rate in discriminating the six assemblages in the BRUVS data. BRUVS are non-extractive and can be used on complex topographies and in sensitive habitats in most or all zones of the Marine Park, but models of bait plumes are needed to convert fish sightings to density estimates. They may have a particular role in studies of larger, rarer elasmobranchs and teleosts of special conservation interest. Trawls can be used in any level of water clarity and provide direct estimates of fish density, particularly those smaller teleosts most vulnerable to the effects of trawling. The complementary use of prawn trawls and BRUVS would enable a more comprehensive assessment of teleost and elasmobranch diversity in the variety of inter-reef seabed topographies and management zones comprising the Marine Park.

abstract = {Global surveys have shown that increased precipitation in mesic to wet ecosystems increases soil carbon storage, but it is not clear how changes in water availability act to affect soil carbon since water is generally in excess of plant demand within these humid ecosystems. Differences in precipitation can affect soil carbon storage either by altering the biotic processes involved in carbon cycling or by altering abiotic processes such as carbon adsorption on soil minerals. We compared the relative effect of water on net primary productivity and decomposition, and on soil weathering and mineralogy in controlling soil carbon storage in forests. Patterns of ecosystem carbon cycling and soil carbon storage were measured in Hawaiian montane forest sites similar in temperature regime, parent material, ecosystem age, vegetation, and topographical relief, while mean annual precipitation alone varied from 2200 to {\textgreater}5000 mm/yr. Soil carbon storage ranged from 30.9 to 62.5 kg/m2 and increased by a factor of 1.7 with increased precipitation across the gradient. Neither changes in total secondary minerals nor noncrystalline mineral content could explain increased soil carbon as both decreased with increasing precipitation. Aboveground net primary productivity, soil carbon dioxide flux, and plant litter decomposition rates also decreased with increased precipitation. These data suggest that increased soil carbon storage was not stimulated by an increase in net primary productivity, but instead by a decrease in decomposition rates. Decreased decomposition rates corresponded with low soil reduction–oxidation potentials, suggesting that soil oxygen availability was limiting to microbes. While soil oxygen did not appear to affect plant growth directly, the decline in net primary productivity corresponded with decreased nitrogen availability, a consequence of slower decomposition and nutrient release. Thus, in humid environments the most important effect of variation in water on carbon cycling appears to be its control on the diffusion of oxygen into the soil.},

abstract = {Floristic composition, structure, and distributional patterns of plant communities were studied along a transect between 350 m and the summit (3055 m) on a windward slope of Mt. Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii. A working hypothesis tested was that plant communities would be altitudinally excessively wide ranging in distribution due to lessened interspecific competition, a putative consequence expected from the island's isolation. The plant communities, classified by Braun-Blanquet's synthesis table technique, were closely correlated with altitude; thus, they characterized discrete vegetation zones. At the top of the classification hierarchy, the rain forest and the treeless high altitude vegetation were differentiated. The rain forest was dominated by a single endemic tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha, with one broad-ranging and two zonally discrete morpho-varieties. The rain forest vegetation was subdivided into two units, corresponding to the lowland and montane zones. These units and the high altitude vegetation were further partitioned into seven plant communities which indicated the following zones: dieback forest belt (450-600 m asl), lowland intact forest (c. 350 and 600-1000 m), lower (1200-1700 m) and upper (1750-1950m) montane forest, forest line (1900-1950m), subalpine scrub (1950-2700 m), and alpine desert (above 2700 m). The upper boundaries of the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones coincided with the lifting condensation level (c. 1000 m), the base of the frequent trade wind inversion (c. 1900m), and the frequent ground-frost line (2700m), respectively. The species turnover rate along the transect, based on similarity values of stands, also showed distinct vegetation boundaries at these altitudes. The strong hierarchical arrangement of the vegetation zones seems to be a characteristic unique to this island mountain. The presence of a large number of associated species over more than one climatic zone, as well as others with more restricted ranges, was responsible for this strong hierarchy.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to predict the future distribution of an invasive macroinvertebrate species, Dikerogammarus villosus, under changing environmental conditions. For this, we used an integrated modelling approach. First, a habitat suitability model (HSM) was constructed on the basis of a regression tree model, to determine the preferred chemical water quality conditions. Subsequently, this HSM was combined with a chemical water quality model that makes predictions on future water quality scenarios for the year 2015 and 2027. It was expected that the area of suitable habitat of D. villosus would increase with improving water quality conditions in the future. Finally, migration speed was incorporated to model the spatial-temporal spread of D. villosus based on a network analysis. On the basis of monitoring data of Flanders (Belgium), it was calculated that D. villosus is able to spread with an average speed of 5 km year(-1).The model simulations indicate that the species is primarily present in large rivers and canals with a good chemical water quality. With improving water quality, the species will be able to colonize additional watercourses, mainly because of a decrease in chemical oxygen demand and orthophosphate concentration. A validation based on the observed occurrence shows that the model accurately predicts areas with a high suitability that are most likely to be invaded by D. villosus. Our integrated modelling approach is useful as a practical method to perform risk assessment for watercourses that are vulnerable to invasions not only in Flanders but also in the whole world.

abstract = {Aim To delineate biogeographical patterns in Galapagos shallow-water reef fauna at regional scales. Location Galapagos Islands. Methods Fishes and macro-invertebrates were quantitatively censused using underwater visual techniques along more than 500 transects at defined depth strata across the Galapagos archipelago. Data were analysed using multivariate techniques to define regional patterns and identify species typical of different regions. Results Subtidal communities of fishes and macro-invertebrates on shallow reefs differed consistently in species composition across the Galapagos archipelago, with three major biogeographical groupings: (1) the 'far-northern area' containing the islands of Darwin and Wolf, (2) the 'central/south-eastern area', including the east coast of Isabela, and (3) the 'western area', encompassing Fernandina and western Isabela. In addition, the northern islands of Pinta, Marchena and Genovesa form a separate region in the central/south-eastern area, and Bahia Elizabeth and Canal Bolivar separate from other parts of the western area. The far-northern bioregion is characterized by high fish species richness overall, including a high proportion of species of Indo-Pacific origin. However, very few endemic fishes or species with distributions extending south from Ecuador ('Peruvian' species) are present, and the bioregion also possesses relatively low species richness of mobile macro-invertebrate taxa. By contrast, the 'western' bioregion possesses disproportionately high numbers of endemic fish taxa, high numbers of cool-temperate Peruvian fish species, and high invertebrate species richness, but very few species of Indo-Pacific origin. The Bahia Elizabeth/Canal Bolivar bioregion possesses more endemic species and fewer species with Peruvian affinities than coasts within the western bioregion. The northern bioregion of Pinta, Marchena and Genovesa represents an overlap zone with affinities to both the far-northern and south-eastern islands. The south-eastern bioregion includes species from a variety of different sources, particularly 'Panamic' species with distributions extending north to Central America. Main conclusions On the basis of congruent divisions for reef fish and macro-invertebrate communities, the Galapagos archipelago can be separated into three major biogeographical areas, two of which can be further subdivided into two regions. Each of these five bioregions possesses communities characterized by a distinctive mix of species derived from Indo-Pacific, Panamic, Peruvian and endemic source areas. The conservation significance of different regions is not reflected in counts of total species richness. The regions with the lowest overall fish species richness possess a temperate rather than tropical climate and highest levels of endemism.},

However, movement data from individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe observation error. Linking such complex data to dynamical models of movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These estimates are supported by recent, independent estimations of net carbon emissions globally, over the Brazilian Amazon, and by observations of atmospheric CO2 emissions over Southeast Asia. Our best estimate for global net emissions from land-use change in the tropics is at 1.1 ± 0.3 Gt C yr?1.

abstract = {Canopy-dwelling epiphytes and their associated dead organic matter exist as complex subsystems of many forests, but they have only rarely been quantified in the context of the whole ecosystem. We assessed the biomass and nutrient capital of canopy-dwelling and terrestrially rooted components of a primary and an adjacent secondary montane forest in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Total aboveground terrestrially rooted biomass (dry weight) was 490.1 and 151 t ha-1 in the primary and secondary forest, respectively. The primary forest supported a total canopy biomass of 33.1 t ha-1; the secondary forest supported only 0.5{\%} of that, 0.2 t ha-1. Trunk and branch epiphyte biomass in the primary forest was over 40 times and 100 times greater than trunk and branch epiphyte biomass in the secondary forest. The bulk (ca. 95{\%}) of the ecosystem biomass is trunk and branch wood, which is slower to decompose than the non-woody, labile components of foliage and non-woody epiphytes. In contrast to the primary forest, where dead organic matter (crown humus, intercepted litterfall) comprised over 60{\%} of the total epiphytic material, there were only trace amounts in the secondary forest. The important ecosystem roles performed by this material in the primary forest (e.g., retention of atmospheric nutrients, habitat for canopy invertebrates, and substrate for wildlife and bird foraging) are virtually absent in the secondary forest canopy. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sea eutrophication is a natural process of water enrichment caused by increased nutrient loading that severely affects coastal ecosystems by decreasing water quality. The degree of eutrophication can be assessed by chlorophyll-a concentration. This study aims to develop a remote sensing method suitable for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations in tropical coastal waters with abundant phytoplankton using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra imagery and to improve the spatial resolution of MODIS/Terra-based estimation from 1 km to 100 m by geostatistics. A model based on the ratio of green and blue band reflectance (rGBr) is proposed considering the bio-optical property of chlorophyll-a. Tien Yen Bay in northern Vietnam, a typical phytoplankton-rich coastal area, was selected as a case study site. The superiority of rGBr over two existing representative models, based on the blue-green band ratio and the red-near infrared band ratio, was demonstrated by a high correlation of the estimated chlorophyll-a concentrations at 40 sites with values measured in situ. Ordinary kriging was then shown to be highly capable of predicting the concentration for regions of the image covered by clouds and, thus, without sea surface data. Resultant space-time maps of concentrations over a year clarified that Tien Yen Bay is characterized by natural eutrophic waters, because the average of chlorophyll-a concentrations exceeded 10 mg/m3 in the summer. The temporal changes of chlorophyll-a concentrations were consistent with average monthly air temperatures and precipitation. Consequently, a combination of rGBr and ordinary kriging can effectively monitor water quality in tropical shallow waters.},

abstract = {The Andes of Ecuador are known for their outstanding biodiversity but also as the region with the highest deforestation rate in South America. This process is accompanied by accelerating degradation and loss of environmental services. Despite an extraordinary richness in native tree diversity, more than 90{\%} of all forest plantations established in Ecuador consist of exotic species, primarily Eucalyptus spp. and Pinus spp. This is mainly due to the lack of information about the autecological and synecological requirements of the native species. The present study aims at providing basic knowledge on the early height development of native species in comparison to exotics. 12,000 seedlings of exotic and native species were planted in experimental trials at three sites of different successional stages: recently abandoned pastures (Setaria sphacelata), bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum) and shrubs. The results presented in this study refer to the status of the seedlings 3 years after planting. Soil data were revealed from soil core analysis from a total of 1008 soil samples distributed systematically over all plots. Soil chemical data were derived from a subsample of 125 randomly selected soil core sites. Soil properties in the study area emerged to be extremely heterogeneous. More than 60{\%} of all plots presented two or more soil clusters. Soils in general were very poor in plant available N. Soil heterogeneity affected extractable Mn and Mg, dominating vegetation cover in turn affected Mn and P. Differences in soil properties had a strong effect for Eucalyptus saligna and Alnus acuminata. Manual above ground weeding showed species-specific effects: Tabebuia chrysantha and Heliocarpus americanus showed improved height growth, while that of Cedrela montana was reduced. There is evidence that A. acuminata can compete in growth with exotic species. Early successional species and exotics performed best on pasture dominated sites. Height growth of the mid-successional species C. montana was facilitated by bracken fern under certain soil conditions, and shrubs facilitated growth of T. chrysantha. The results indicate that reforestation with native species in Ecuador is possible but requires intensive consideration of interactions with soil properties and accompanying vegetation. Macroscopic soil core analysis can be a suitable instrument for detecting small-scale variation of soil properties. Nevertheless, a characterisation of both small-scale variation as well as variation on higher spatial scales, for instance by aerial photographs, is essential for effective planning of reforestation measures in the Andes. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Aim Distribution modelling relates sparse data on species occurrence or abundance to environmental information to predict the population of a species at any point in space. Recently, the importance of spatial autocorrelation in distributions has been recognized. Spatial autocorrelation can be categorized as exogenous (stemming from autocorrelation in the underlying variables) or endogenous (stemming from activities of the organism itself, such as dispersal). Typically, one asks whether spatial models explain additional variability (endogenous) in comparison to a fully specified habitat model. We turned this question around and asked: can habitat models explain additional variation when spatial structure is accounted for in a fully specified spatially explicit model? The aim was to find out to what degree habitat models may be inadvertently capturing spatial structure rather than true explanatory mechanisms. Location We used data from 190 species of the North American Breeding Bird Survey covering the conterminous United States and southern Canada. Methods We built 13 different models on 190 bird species using regression trees. Our habitat-based models used climate and landcover variables as independent variables. We also used random variables and simulated ranges to validate our results. The two spatially explicit models included only geographical coordinates or a contagion term as independent variables. As another angle on the question of mechanism vs. spatial structure we pitted a model using related bird species as predictors against a model using randomly selected bird species. Results The spatially explicit models outperformed the traditional habitat models and the random predictor species outperformed the related predictor species. In addition, environmental variables produced a substantial R2 in predicting artificial ranges. Main conclusions We conclude that many explanatory variables with suitable spatial structure can work well in species distribution models. The predictive power of environmental variables is not necessarily mechanistic, and spatial interpolation can outperform environmental explanatory variables.},

abstract = {Tropical ecosystems play a key role in the global carbon cycle, but their response to global warming is not well understood. Altitudinal gradients offer the unique possibility of undertaking in situ experimental studies of the influence of alterations in climate on the carbon (C) cycle. In a soil-translocation experiment we took replicate soil cores at 3030 m, 1500 m, 1000 m and 200 m above sea level along an altitudinal gradient in tropical forest in Peru, and exchanged (i.e. translocated) them among these sites to observe the influence of altered climatic conditions on the decomposition of soil organic matter under natural field conditions. Soil respiration rates of the translocated soil cores and adjacent undisturbed soils were measured twice a month from April 2007 to October 2007. The temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration in each core was examined using a Lloyd {\&} Taylor function and a simple modified third-order polynomial fit. Calculated Q(10) values decreased with decreasing altitude using both mathematical functions (2.53-1.24 according to the Lloyd {\&} Taylor function, and 2.56-0.63 using the polynomial fit). Soil organic C-stocks increased markedly and linearly with altitude, but surprisingly the average total soil respiration rate did not vary significantly with altitude along the transect (3.98-4.31 mu mol CO2 m-2 s-1). This implies an increase with elevation of absolute C allocation to below-ground allocation.},

abstract = {Tidal streams are complex watercourses that represent a transitional zone between riverine and marine systems; they occur where fresh and marine waters converge. Because tidal circulation processes cause substantial turbulence in these highly dynamic zones, tidal streams are the most productive of water bodies. Their rich biological diversity, combined with the convenience of land and water transports, provide sites for concentrated populations that evolve into large cities. Domestic wastewater is generally discharged directly into tidal streams in Taiwan, necessitating regular evaluation of the water quality of these streams. Given the complex flow dynamics of tidal streams, only a few models can effectively evaluate and identify pollution levels. This study evaluates the river pollution index (RPI) in tidal streams by using kriging analysis. This is a geostatistical method for interpolating random spatial variation to estimate linear grid points in two or three dimensions. A kriging-based method is developed to evaluate RPI in tidal streams, which is typically considered as 1D in hydraulic engineering. The proposed method efficiently evaluates RPI in tidal streams with the minimum amount of water quality data. Data of the Tanshui River downstream reach available from an estuarine area validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method. Results of this study demonstrate that this simple yet reliable method can effectively estimate RPI in tidal streams.},

abstract = {Current attempts to explain the persistence of carbon in soils focuses on explanations such as the recalcitrant plant residues and the physical isolation of substrates from decomposers. A pool of organic matter that can persist for centuries to millennia is hypothesized because of the evidence provided by the persistence of pre-disturbance C in fallow or vegetation change experiments, and the radiocarbon age of soil carbon. However, new information, which became available through advances in the ability to measure the isotope signatures of specific compounds, favors a new picture of organic matter dynamics. Instead of persistence of plant-derived residues like lignin in the soil, the majority of mineral soil is in molecules derived from microbial synthesis. Carbon recycled multiple times through the microbial community can be old, decoupling the radio- carbon age of C atoms from the chemical or biological lability of the molecules they comprise. In consequence is soil microbiology, a major control on soil carbon dynamics, which highlights the potential vulnerability of soil organic matter to changing environmental condi- tions. Moreover, it emphasizes the need to devise new management options to restore, increase, and secure this valuable resource.},

abstract = {An extensive bio-optical data set from field measurements was used to evaluate the performance of standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color (in-water) algorithms in the Baltic Sea, which represents an example of optically complex Case 2 waters with high concentration of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The data set includes coincident measurements of radiometric quantities, chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), and absorption coefficient of CDOM, which were taken on 25 cruises between 1993 and 2001. The data cover a wide range of variability with Chl a in surface waters from about 0.3 to 100 mg m-3. All the MODIS pigment algorithms examined as well as the SeaWiFS OC4v4 algorithm showed a systematic and large overestimation in chlorophyll retrievals. The mean systematic and random errors based on our entire data set exceeded 150{\%} or even 200{\%} in some cases, making these standard algorithms inadequate for pigment determinations in the Baltic. Although new parameterization of the standard pigment algorithms based on our field measurements in the Baltic resulted in a significant reduction of errors, the overall performance of such regionally tuned algorithms remained unsatisfactory. For example, the mean normalized bias (MNB) for the regionally tuned MODIS chlor{\_}a{\_}2 algorithm was reduced to 26{\%} (from over 200{\%} for the standard algorithm), but the root mean square (RMS) error was still large ({\textgreater}100{\%}). The MODIS K{\_}490 algorithm for estimating the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance showed the best performance among all the algorithms examined. With the new coefficients based on our field data, the regional version of this algorithm showed an acceptable level of errors, MNB=4{\%} and RMS=30{\%}. In addition to the apparent problems of the standard in-water bio-optical algorithms, we found that the atmospheric correction currently in use for MODIS and SeaWiFS imagery usually fails to retrieve upwelling radiances emerging from the Baltic Sea. The match-up comparisons of the coincident in situ and satellite determinations of normalized water-leaving radiances showed generally poor agreement, especially in the blue spectral region. It appears that new approaches for ocean color algorithms are required in the Baltic Sea. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although explicit time integration schemes require small computational efforts per time step, their efficiency is severely restricted by their stability limits. Indeed, the multi-scale nature of some physical processes combined with highly unstructured meshes can lead some elements to impose a severely small stable time step for a global problem. Multirate methods offer a way to increase the global efficiency by gathering grid cells in appropriate groups under local stability conditions. These methods are well suited to the discontinuous Galerkin framework. The parallelization of the multirate strategy is challenging because grid cells have different workloads. The computational cost is different for each sub-time step depending on the elements involved and a classical partitioning strategy is not adequate any more. In this paper, we propose a solution that makes use of multi-constraint mesh partitioning. It tends to minimize the inter-processor communications, while ensuring that the workload is almost equally shared by every computer core at every stage of the algorithm. Particular attention is given to the simplicity of the parallel multirate algorithm while minimizing computational and communication overheads. Our implementation makes use of the MeTiS library for mesh partitioning and the Message Passing Interface for inter-processor communication. Performance analyses for two and three-dimensional practical applications confirm that multirate methods preserve important computational advantages of explicit methods up to a significant number of processors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The altitudes of the ecotones between the main vegetation-zones up mountains of the humid tropics are reviewed, with emphasis on floristics and those areas with which the author is personally familiar. A detailed comparison is made of the zonation on Mt Kinabalu (c. 6°N) and the Himalaya of Bhutan (c. 27°N), and is supported by information from other parts of SE Asia, and to a decreasing extent South America and Africa. The relationship between forest-types based on structure and physiognomy and forest-types based on floristics is complicated. In SE Asia lower montane forests may be dominated by dipterocarps or an ‘oak-laurel' assemblage. The dominant leaf size in both is notophyll, but the oak-laurel assemblage shifts to the microphyll size-class in China where the transition from tropical lower montane to warm temperate lowland forest begins. The opposite trend is seen where the lower montane flora of Papua New Guinea corresponds to the lowland flora in NE Australia. There are only modest changes between the Equator and the Tropic in the altitudes at which major transitions occur. It is concluded that soil changes, mediated only in part by temperature and associated climatic factors, may play a more direct and diverse role than has previously been indicated. The soil factors emphasized are the increase in organic matter content in lower montane soils as opposed to lowland, accompanied by a change from termite-dominance to earthworm-dominance, and the frequent occurrence of a dense moss layer and mor humus in upper montane soils. The case is made particularly by reference to east Asian mountains, which have been the most studied.},

abstract = {Fog is a defining feature of the coastal California redwood forest and fog inputs via canopy drip in summer can constitute 30{\%} or more of the total water input each year. A great deal of occult precipitation (fog and light rain) is retained in redwood canopies, which have some of the largest leaf area indices known (Westman {\&} Whittaker, Journal of Ecology 63, 493–520, 1975). An investigation was carried out to determine whether some fraction of intercepted fog water might be directly absorbed through leaf surfaces and if so, the importance of this to the water relations physiology of coast redwood, Sequoia sempervirens. An array of complimentary techniques were adopted to demonstrate that fog is absorbed directly by S. sempervirens foliage. Xylem sap transport reversed direction during heavy fog, with instantaneous flow rates in the direction of the soil peaking at approximately 5–7{\%} of maximum transpiration rate. Isotopic analyses showed that up to 6{\%} of a leaf's water content could be traced to a previous night's fog deposition, but this amount varied considerably depending on the age and water status of the leaves. Old leaves, which appear most able to absorb fog water were able to absorb distilled water when fully submersed at an average rate of 0.90 mmol m2 s−1, or about 80{\%} of transpiration rates measured at the leaf level in the field. Sequoia sempervirens has poor stomatal control in response to a drying atmosphere, with rates of water loss on very dry nights up to 40{\%} of midday summer values and rates above 10{\%} being extremely common. Owing to this profligate water use behaviour of S. sempervirens, it appears that fog has a greater role in suppressing water loss from leaves, and thereby ameliorating daily water stress, than in providing supplemental water to foliar tissues per se. Although direct foliar absorption from fog inputs represents only a small fraction of the water used each day, fog's in reducing transpiration and rehydrating leaf tissues during the most active growth periods in summer may allow for greater seasonal carbon fixation and thus contribute to the very fast growth rates and great size of this species.},

A 2D depth-averaged version of the model is applied to the Mahakam Delta (Borneo, Indonesia), the adjacent ocean, and three lakes in the central part of the Mahakam River catchment. The 2D code is coupled to a 1D section-averaged model for the Mahakam River and four tributaries. The coupled 2D/1D model is mainly aimed at simulating fine-grained sediment transport in the riverine and marine water continuum of the Mahakam River system. Using the observations of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at five locations in the computational domain, the modelling parameters are first determined in a calibration step, for a given period of time. A validation step is then performed using data related to another period of time. It is concluded that the coupled 2D/1D model reproduces very well the observed suspended sediment distribution within the delta. The spatial distribution of sediment concentration in the delta and its temporal variation are also discussed.},

abstract = {Stratification and nutrient loading are two primary factors leading to hypoxia in coastal systems. However, where these factors are temporally correlated, it can be difficult to isolate and quantify their individual impacts. This study provides a novel solution to this problem by determining the effect of stratification based on its spatial relationship with bottom-water dissolved oxygen (BWDO) concentration using a geostatistical regression. Ten years (1998-2007) of midsummer Gulf of Mexico BWDO measurements are modeled using stratification metrics along with trends based on spatial coordinates and bathymetry, which together explain 27-61{\%} of the spatial variability in BWDO for individual years. Because stratification effects explain only a portion of the year-to-year variability in mean BWDO; the remaining variability is explained by other factors, with May nitrate plus nitrite river concentration the most important. Overall, 82{\%} of the year-to-year variability in mean BWDO is explained. The results suggest that while both stratification and nutrients play important roles in determining the annual extent of midsummer hypoxia, reducing nutrient inputs alone will substantially reduce the average extent.},

abstract = {1. Joint species distribution models (JSDM) are increasingly used to analyse community ecology data. Recent progress with JSDMs has provided ecologists with new tools for estimating species associations (residual co- occurrence patterns after accounting for environmental niches) from large data sets, as well as for increasing the predictive power of species distributionmodels (SDMs) by accounting for such associations.Yet, one critical lim- itation of JSDMs developed thus far is that they assume constant species associations.However, in real ecologi- cal communities, the direction and strength of interspecific interactions are likely to be different under different environmental conditions. 2. In this paper, we overcome the shortcoming of present JSDMs by allowing species associations covary with measured environmental covariates. To estimate environmental-dependent species associations, we utilize a latent variable structure, where the factor loadings are modelled as a linear regression to environmental covari- ates. 3. Weillustrate the performance of the statistical frameworkwith both simulated and real data. Our results show that JSDMs perform substantially better in inferring environmental-dependent species associations than single SDMs, especially with sparse data. Furthermore, JSDMs consistently overperform SDMs in terms of predictive power for generating predictions that account for environment-dependent biotic associations. 4. We implemented the statistical framework as a MATLAB package, which includes tools both for model parameterization as well as for post-processing of results, particularly for addressing whether and how species associations depend on the environmental conditions. 5. Our statistical framework provides a new tool for ecologists who wish to investigate from non-manipulative observational community data the dependency of interspecific interactions on environmental context. Our method canbe appliedtoanswerthe fundamentalquestions in community ecology about how species' interac- tions shift in changing environmental conditions, as well as to predict future changes of species' interactions in response to global change.},

Mean stem diameter remained constant from the base of the gradient to 1500 m a.s.l., increasing slightly at higher altitudes. Large-diameter trees were least abundant at middle altitudes. Basal area was greatest near the summit, exceeding 40 m(2) ha(-1) in the two highest plots. 5 Diversity was highest at 300 m, with 149 species and 55 families per hectare. There was a progressive decrease both above and below this altitude in species richness, species diversity, number of families, and the number of species per family. Diversity was lowest at the summit. 6 Five life-forms were recorded: dicot trees comprised 78.0{\%} of stems; palms 14.9{\%}; tree ferns 5.2{\%}; lianas 1.5{\%}; and hemi-epiphytes 0.4{\%}. Life-form distribution varied markedly over the gradient. 7 Species composition varied continuously with altitude, as shown by a detrended correspondence analysis ordination of data from 375 20-m x 20-m subplots.

The species with the greatest amplitude, Ardisia palmana, occurred over 75{\%} of the gradient (a range of around 2000 m). A total of 203 species were recorded from only a single 1-ha plot. 9 The altitudinal range of species did not vary with altitude: the range of lowland species was similar to that of montane species, Species of high-diversity assemblages (encountered at low altitude) were similar in altitudinal niche breadth to species of low-diversity assemblages (found at high altitude).},

Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.},

abstract = {Environmental processes (e.g., groundwater contaminants, air pollution patterns, air-water and air-soil energy exchanges) are characterized by variability and uncertainty. Spatiotemporal random fields are used to represent correlations between fluctuations in the composite space-time domain. Modelling the effects of fluctuations with suitable covariance functions can improve our ability to characterize and predict space-time variations in various natural systems (e.g., environmental media, long-term climatic evolutions on local/global scales, and human exposure to pollutants). The goal of this work is to present the reader with various methods for constructing space-time covariance models. In this context, we provide a mathematical exposition and visual representations of several theoretical covariance models. These include non-separable (in space and time) covariance models derived from physical laws (i.e., differential equations and dynamic rules), spectral functions, and generalized random fields. It is also shown that non-separability is often a direct result of the physical laws that govern the process. The proposed methods can generate covariance models for homogeneous/stationary as well as for non-homogeneous/non-stationary environmental processes across space and time. We investigate several properties (short-range and asymptotic behavior, shape of the covariance function etc.) of these models and present plots of the space-time dependence for various parameter values. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Rainfall exceeding a cumulative total of 40 mm over 3 days accounted for 60{\%} of migrant eels arriving at Aniwhenua.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Accurately monitoring tropical forest carbon stocks is an outstanding challenge. Allometric models that consider tree diameter, height and wood density as predictors are currently used in most tropical forest carbon studies. In particular, a pantropical biomass model has been widely used for approximately a decade, and its most recent version will certainly constitute a reference in the coming years. However, this reference model shows a systematic bias for the largest trees. Because large trees are key drivers of forest carbon stocks and dynamics, understanding the origin and the consequences of this bias is of utmost concern. In this study, we compiled a unique tree mass dataset on 673 trees measured in five tropical countries (101 trees {\textgreater} 100 cm in diameter) and an original dataset of 130 forest plots (1 ha) from central Africa to quantify the error of biomass allometric models at the individual and plot levels when explicitly accounting or not accounting for crown mass variations. We first showed that the proportion of crown to total tree aboveground biomass is highly variable among trees, ranging from 3 to 88 {\%}. This proportion was constant on average for trees {\textless} 10 Mg (mean of 34 {\%}) but, above this threshold, increased sharply with tree mass and exceeded 50 {\%} on average for trees {\&}ge; 45 Mg. This increase coincided with a progressive deviation between the pantropical biomass model estimations and actual tree mass. Accounting for a crown mass proxy in a newly developed model consistently removed the bias observed for large trees ({\textgreater} 1 Mg) and reduced the range of plot-level error from −23–16 to 0–10 {\%}. The disproportionally higher allocation of large trees to crown mass may thus explain the bias observed recently in the reference pantropical model. This bias leads to far-from-negligible, but often overlooked, systematic errors at the plot level and may be easily corrected by accounting for a crown mass proxy for the largest trees in a stand, thus suggesting that the accuracy of forest carbon estimates can be significantly improved at a minimal cost.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Shading resulted in an increase of biomass accumulation at all altitudes. A close relationship, independent of altitude, was observed between d 13 C and specific leaf area, suggesting that internal resistance could limit CO 2 diffusion to the site of carboxylation.

If tropical farmers cannot be provided with sustainable land-use systems, which address their subsistence needs and keep them gainfully employed, tropical forests will continue to disappear.  We looked at the ability of economic land-use diversification – with reforestation of tropical “wastelands” as a key activity – to halt deforestation at the farm level. Our ecological–economic concept, based on land-use data from the buffer area of the Podocarpus National Park in southern Ecuador, shows that stopping deforestation after 10 years is possible without violating subsistence demands.  Tropical, farm-level diversification may not only reduce total deforestation by 45{\%}, but also increase farmers' profits by 65{\%}, because the formerly unproductive wastelands have been returned to productive land use.  We therefore conclude that a “win–win” scenario is possible: the subsistence needs of people can be reconciled with conservation objectives.   Restoring natural resources in conjunction with tropical forest conversion and product diversification can reduce farmers' risk of losses and the demand for land; this concept applies particularly to subsistence farms located in montane tropical ecosystems, where slow succession of overused, degraded, and abandoned lands toward secondary forests is characteristic},

abstract = {An accurate estimate of carbon fluxes associated with tropical deforestation from the last two decades is needed to balance the global carbon budget. Several studies have already estimated carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, but the estimates vary greatly and are difficult to compare due to differences in data sources, assumptions and methodologies. In this paper, we review the different estimates and datasets, and the various challenges associated with comparing them and with accurately estimating carbon emissions from deforestation. We performed a simulation study over legal Amazonia to illustrate some of these major issues. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of considering land-cover dynamics following deforestation, including the fluxes from reclearing of secondary vegetation, the decay of product and slash pools, and the fluxes from regrowing forest. It also suggests that accurate carbon-flux estimates will need to consider historical land-cover changes for at least the previous 20 years. However, this result is highly sensitive to estimates of the partitioning of cleared carbon into instantaneous burning vs. long-timescale slash pools. We also show that carbon flux estimates based on 'committed flux' calculations, as used by a few studies, are not comparable with the 'annual balance' calculation method used by other studies},

However, several sources of bias still undermine the ability of these methods to accurately estimate abundances of some species. The present study introduces FishCensus, a spatially-explicit individual-based model that simulates underwater visual census of fish populations. The model features small temporal and spatial scales and uses a movement algorithm which can be shaped to reflect complex behaviours and effects of diver presence. Four different types of fish were used in the model, featuring typically problematic behavioural traits, namely schooling behaviour, cryptic habits, shyness and boldness. Corresponding control types were also modelled, lacking only the key behavioural traits. Sampling was conducted by a virtual diver using four true fish densities and employing two distinct methods: strip transects and stationary point counts. Comparisons with control fish have shown that schooling and bold behaviours induce positive bias and reduce precision, while cryptic and shy behaviours induce negative bias and increase precision, although shy behaviour did not have a significant effect on precision in transects. By looking at deviations from true density, however, schooling, shy and bold fish densities were strongly overestimated by both methods, while cryptic fish were slightly underestimated. Schooling and bold fish had the lowest precision overall, followed by shy fish. Fish rarity decreased precision, but had no effect on bias. Stationary points had less precision than transects for all fish types, and led to much higher counts, resulting in greater overestimation of density overall. By modelling complex behaviour, it was possible to separate the contributions of detectability and non-instantaneous sampling on bias, and gain a deeper understanding of the effect of behavioural traits on UVC estimates. The model can be used as a tool for planning and optimization of monitoring programs or to calculate conversion factors for past or ongoing surveys, assuming behavioural patterns are well replicated.},

abstract = {In situ fixed acoustic telemetry methods make it possible to study simultaneously the detailed movements of individual fish and their relationship to the environment, but the properties of these methods is little known in harsh physical conditions. We examined the probability of tag detection by the system and the positioning error for detected tags of an existing telemetry system installed with 32 fixed hydrophones in a reach of the fast-flowing Rh{\^{o}}ne River in France. The reach was 1.8. km long and had heterogeneous thermal and hydraulic conditions described by a two-dimensional hydraulic model. We compared positions detected by the system with true positions estimated using a tachometer or a differential GPS, for various sets of experimental tag emissions. We analyzed how the probability of detection and the positioning error were affected by user-defined variables and three groups of environmental variables describing the configuration of the hydrophones around tag position, the physical environment at tag position and the reception quality. Tag emissions from the center channel had an average probability of detection (40-50{\%}) higher than emissions originating from positions close to the banks, and were positioned with smaller average errors (3-5. m). The probability of detection of emissions typically varied between near 0{\%} and 80{\%} with configuration variables (density of surrounding hydrophones and location of tag relative to the hydrophones) and also decreased in the presence of coarse substrate. The positioning error was mainly reduced when user-defined variables of the triangulation software were set by an expert user. Configuration variables also influenced the positioning error with weaker effects than those observed for detection probability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is generally considered the most common limiting nutrient for productivity of mature tropical lowland forests growing on highly weathered soils. It is often assumed that P limitation also applies to young tropical forests, but nitrogen (N) losses during land-use change may alter the stoichiometric balance of nutrient cycling processes. In the Amazon basin, about 16{\%} of the original forest area has been cleared, and about 30-50{\%} of cleared land is estimated now to be in some stage of secondary forest succession following agricultural abandonment. Here we use forest age chronosequences to demonstrate that young successional forests growing after agricultural abandonment on highly weathered lowland tropical soils exhibit conservative N-cycling properties much like those of N-limited forests on younger soils in temperate latitudes. As secondary succession progresses, N-cycling properties recover and the dominance of a conservative P cycle typical of mature lowland tropical forests re-emerges. These successional shifts in N:P cycling ratios with forest age provide a mechanistic explanation for initially lower and then gradually increasing soil emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N(2)O). The patterns of N and P cycling during secondary forest succession, demonstrated here over decadal timescales, are similar to N- and P-cycling patterns during primary succession as soils age over thousands and millions of years, thus revealing that N availability in terrestrial ecosystems is ephemeral and can be disrupted by either natural or anthropogenic disturbances at several timescales.},

abstract = {We examined $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N in needle (current and 1-year-old) and soil samples collected on two occasions (July and September 1999) from a 15-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand in an irrigation and fertilization experiment to investigate whether these treatments leave specific isotope signals in the samples and thus to infer the effects of treatments on C and N cycling. Irrespective of foliar age or sampling date, carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$) was increased by irrigation, and decreased by fertilization. The carbon isotope discrimination model suggested that increased $\Delta$ by irrigation was due to decreased water use efficiency (WUE) through increased stomatal and/or mesophyll conductance. The decreased $\Delta$ by fertilization and published gas exchange measurements at the same site suggest that water stress resulting from increased water demand in the fertilized plots improved WUE through increased stomatal control of water loss. Foliar $\delta$15N values were not affected by irrigation, but were increased by fertilization. The $\delta$15N value of soil NH4+ were higher than those of NO3− and were positively correlated with foliar $\delta$15N, suggesting that tree uptake of NH4+ was one of the factors affecting foliar $\delta$15N. We conclude that irrigation and fertilization affected $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values in plant and soil samples, reflecting changed C and N cycling patterns and water use efficiency in the studied loblolly pine stand.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

Here, we address the question of the dynamics of metacommunities in highly variable systems, using intermittent rivers (IRs), those rivers which temporarily stop fl owing or dry up, as a model system. We fi rst review how habitat heterogeneity in space and time infl uences metacommunity organisation. Second, we compare the metacommunities in IRs to those in perennial rivers (PRs) and develop the idea that IRs could undergo highly dynamic shifts due to the temporal variability in local and regional community processes. Th ird, we develop the idea that in IRs, metacommunities of the wet and dry phases of IRs are closely intertwined, thereby increasing even more their respective temporal dynamics. Last, we provide a roadmap to stimulate further conceptual and empirical developments of metacommunity research and identify possible applications for improving the management of IRs and other highly dynamic ecological systems.},

Thermal behavior of eels was highly variable, both among individuals of the various test groups and among repeated tests of single individuals. Light inhibited behavioral thermoregulation by promoting shelter-seeking. The following inferences are drawn from the laboratory findings and observations of migrating A. rostrata and A. anguilla (European eels) in the North Atlantic: (1) decreasing temperatures may initiate downstream migration of silver eels, (2) eels may select temperatures close to their FPT in thermally stratified environments, but will tolerate higher and lower temperatures depending on illumination or other physical constraints, (3) the oceanic phase of the migration to the Sargasso Sea may take place at relatively shallow depths in the open ocean, probably within the upper 1000 meters.

@article{Sidle2006,
abstract = {To assess the effects of forest management on soil erosion in Southeast Asia, clear distinctions must be made between surface erosion and landslide processes. Although surface erosion is a natural process, it is exacerbated by surface disturbance and compaction that reduce the soil hydraulic conductivity and break down soil aggregates. Management practices and attributes such as roads and trails, agricultural cultivation, fire, land clearing, and recreation all accelerate surface erosion processes due to their disturbance, compaction, and connectivity along hillslopes. Agroforestry practices in Southeast Asia that incorporate cover crops with trees reduce surface erosion by more than an order of magnitude compared to monoculture plantations with no ground cover. Cleared fields tilled up and down steep slopes are highly erodible; passive conservation practices (e.g., contour tillage, strip cropping, reduced tillage; maintaining adequate ground cover) are effective in reducing surface erosion if properly implemented. Poorly designed and managed terraces are not effective in controlling surface erosion and may actually increase mass wasting if they concentrate water. In contrast to surface erosion, shallow, rapid landslides are episodic processes triggered by individual rainfall events or artificial inputs of water; slower, deep-seated landslides initiate or activate after a longer-term accumulation of water. Thus, landslide assessment must be based on long-term observations. Deep rooted trees and shrubs impart a significant cohesive strength into shallow soil mantles and facilitate preferential drainage, thereby reducing the probability of shallow landslides. Conversion of mountain forests to cropland or plantations permanently reduces rooting strength, thus increasing landslide potential, while timber harvesting with subsequent regeneration of secondary forests reduces rooting strength for up to two decades after initial cutting. Roads contribute the largest surface erosion and landslide losses (per unit area disturbed) compared to other land uses. Both landslide and surface erosion fluxes along roads are typically one to more than two orders of magnitude higher compared to undisturbed steepland forests. High storm runoff from roads is caused by the generation of infiltration-excess overland flow on compacted surfaces and the interception of subsurface flow at road cuts; these altered pathways increase surface erosion and accelerate the delivery of storm runoff to streams. Discharge nodes from roads facilitate the connectivity of water and sediment to headwater streams. Trails, although narrower than roads, can contribute significantly to soil loss and storm runoff and are important sediment conduits if directly linked to channels. Thus, the location of roads and paths with respect to the hydrologic network is a critical factor governing the spatial-temporal movement of sediment and water in the tropics. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, understanding the controls on tropical forest photosynthesis and respiration, and the allocation of the products of photosynthesis to canopy, woody tissue and rhizosphere, is important to understand global ecosystem functioning. 2. I review how studies in tropical ecosystem ecology have progressed since their inception in the 1960s towards developing a quantitative, mechanistic and global description of the carbon cycle of tropical vegetation. 3. I present a synthesis of studies in tropical forest sites in the Americas and Asia for which gross primary productivity (GPP) has been reported, and a subset of these sites for which net primary productivity (NPP) and ecosystem carbon use efficiency (CUE) have been estimated. GPP ranges between 30 and 40 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in lowland moist tropical forests and declines with elevation. CUE in tropical forests is at the low end of the global range reported for forests. 4. A pathway and framework are presented to explain the link between photosynthesis and tropical forest biomass, and to explain differences in carbon cycling and biomass between forests. Variation in CUE and allocation of NPP can be as important as variation in GPP in explaining differences in tropical forest growth rates between sites. 5. Finally, I explore some of the key questions surrounding the functioning and future of tropical forests in the rapidly changing conditions of the early Anthropocene. 6. Synthesis.There have been significant recent advances in quantifying the carbon cycle of tropical forests, but our understanding of causes of variation amongst forests is still poor. Moreover, we should expect all tropical forests in the 21st century, whether intact or disturbed, to be undergoing rapid change in function and composition; the key challenge for tropical ecosystem ecologists is to determine and understand the major and most fundamental aspects of this change.},

abstract = {The altitudes of the ecotones between the main vegetation-zones up mountains of the humid tropics are reviewed, with emphasis on floristics and those areas with which the author is personally familiar. A detailed comparison is made of the zonation on Mt Kinabalu (c. 6°N) and the Himalaya of Bhutan (c. 27°N), and is supported by information from other parts of SE Asia, and to a decreasing extent South America and Africa. The relationship between forest-types based on structure and physiognomy and forest-types based on floristics is complicated. In SE Asia lower montane forests may be dominated by dipterocarps or an ‘oak-laurel' assemblage. The dominant leaf size in both is notophyll, but the oak-laurel assemblage shifts to the microphyll size-class in China where the transition from tropical lower montane to warm temperate lowland forest begins. The opposite trend is seen where the lower montane flora of Papua New Guinea corresponds to the lowland flora in NE Australia. There are only modest changes between the Equator and the Tropic in the altitudes at which major transitions occur. It is concluded that soil changes, mediated only in part by temperature and associated climatic factors, may play a more direct and diverse role than has previously been indicated. The soil factors emphasized are the increase in organic matter content in lower montane soils as opposed to lowland, accompanied by a change from termite-dominance to earthworm-dominance, and the frequent occurrence of a dense moss layer and mor humus in upper montane soils. The case is made particularly by reference to east Asian mountains, which have been the most studied.},

abstract = {Current threats to biodiversity, combined with limited data availability, have made for species distribution models (SDMs) to be increasingly used due to their ability to predict species??? potential distribution, by relating species occurrence with environmental estimates. Often used in ecology, conservation biology and environmental management, SDMs have been informing conservation strategies, and thus it is becoming crucial to understand how trustworthy their predictions are. Uncertainty in model predictions is expected, but knowing the origin of prediction errors may help reducing it. Indeed, uncertainty may be related not only with data quality and the modelling algorithm used, but also with species ecological characteristics. To investigate whether the performance of SDM's may vary with species??? ecological characteristics, distribution models for 21 fish species occurring in estuaries from the Portuguese coast were examined. These models were built at two distinct spatial resolutions and seven environmental explanatory variables were used as predictors. SDMs??? accuracy was assessed with the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plots, sensitivity and specificity. Relationships between each measure of accuracy and species ecological characteristics were then examined. SDMs of the fish species presented small differences between the considered scales, and predictors as latitude, temperature and salinity were often selected at both scales. Measures of model accuracy presented differences between species and scales, but generally higher accuracy was obtained at smaller spatial scales. Among the ecological traits tested, species feeding mode and estuarine use functional groups were the most influential on the performance of distribution models. Habitat tolerance (number of habitat types frequented), species abundance, body size and spawning period also showed some effect. This analyses will contribute to distinguish, based on species ecological characteristics, between species whose occurrence is reliably or less reliably predicted by distribution models. Fish species assigned to the benthivores feeding group, and using estuaries opportunistically (either as feeding or nursery grounds) seem to be more accurately predicted by SDM's.},

The combination of two datasets resulted in a full description of the estuaries water quality parameters from the mouth to the upper boundary, including an extended fresh water tidal part. A synthesis of the monitoring results and all relevant ecological knowledge on the Scheldt allowed to identify opportunities to optimize its management. The results show that the effect of discharge on salinity has a distinct maximum in the polyhaline to mesohaline transition area. Oxygen conditions, nitrogen removal and phytoplankton regulation can be enhanced and improved through management measures within the estuary. To lower carbon and phosphorous loads however measures should be taken within the catchment. To restore most of its ecological functions the estuary needs more space. Optimal locations to address specific functions can be derived from the monitoring results.},

abstract = {In the wake of recent large-scale observational programs such as Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) and Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC), a number of models have been developed to simulate biogeochemical cycling in various oceanographic regions; however, few quantitative comparisons of these models have been made. In order to assess critically which ecosystem structures and model formulations are best able to simulate observed biogeochemical cycling, three fundamentally different ecosystem models of varying complexity are applied within a consistent one-dimensional (1-D) framework at 15.5??N, 61.5??E in the Arabian Sea. Each model is forced by three different sets of physical forcing fields: two of these are derived from the solutions of different 3-D physical models, while the third is derived from moored observations. In situ concentrations of plankton and nitrogenous nutrients, and rates of production and export measured during the US JGOFS Arabian Sea Expedition are used for assimilation and evaluation. After objectively optimizing each model, their performance is quantitatively compared to assess which model structure best represents the fundamental underlying biogeochemical processes. Results are highly sensitive to the number of parameters optimized for each ecosystem model. A set of cross-validation experiments designed to assess predictive capability demonstrates that when too many parameters are allowed to vary, the more complex models are unable to reproduce any unassimilated data, suggesting that under these conditions the models have little predictive skill. Optimizing only an objectively and systematically selected subset of uncorrelated model parameters minimizes this problem. The method developed to accomplish this parameter selection is presented. After this optimization method is applied, all three models behave similarly, implying that the additional complexity of a multiple size-class model may not be advantageous. Furthermore, a change in physical model (mixed-layer depth and vertical velocity fields) typically produces a far greater change in biogeochemical model response than does a change in ecosystem model complexity, highlighting the fact that biogeochemical variability is largely determined by the physical environment both in situ and in the model domain. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The behaviour patterns of yellow-stage European eels Anguilla anguilla within the tidal waters of the rivers Frome and Piddle, and the neighbouring Poole Harbour estuary (Dorset, England) were examined from July to December using acoustic transmitters and a fixed hydrophone array. Point-to-point measures of range varied between 630m and 4150m, with no relationship between eel size and range. Eight eels displayed repeated circuits, travelling distances of 440m to 5060m over a few hours. Activity was generally, but not exclusively, nocturnal, with the start and end times closely associated with sunset and sunrise, respectively. Neither direction of travel nor average ground speed was influenced by tidal flow direction, and seasonal declines in water temperature did not appear to influence behaviours. These results on distance travelled during regular, nocturnal movements provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of yellow eels in an estuarine environment, which can aid the design of survey programmes in terms of the range over which to deploy fishing gears and the number of nights they should be fished. These survey programmes are urgently required to estimate eel production from saline environments for national Eel Management Plans, and the subsequent implementation of effective conservation measures. The strong influence of light regime on the behaviour patterns of eels points towards control of artificial illumination (light pollution) being an important eel conservation measure in this environment, at least. {\textcopyright} 2013 Crown.},

abstract = {1. A new open-top chamber for measuring CO2 efflux from the soil is reported here. The new design enables measurement of the equilibrium CO2 efflux, when there is no detectable pressure difference between the chamber and outside nor leakage of CO2 into or out of the chamber. 2. In previous dynamic-chamber techniques, the measured CO2 efflux is dependent on the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the chamber, and a negative pressure difference of -1Pa may cause an order of magnitude increase in measured CO2 efflux. Although the measured CO2 efflux is less sensitive to a positive pressure difference than to a negative one, a positive pressure difference of even a few tenths of a Pa will lead to a considerable underestimation in soil CO2 evolution. 3. The influence of pressure difference on measured CO2 efflux is negligible in the new design and the estimated CO2 efflux is close to the undisturbed soil respiration rate. Flow rates up to 8lmin-1, or air movement over the soil surface up to 55cmmin-1, will not affect CO2 evolution from the soil. The influence of pressure difference is related to the type of soil being measured and this has also been reported here for the new design.},

abstract = {Tropical forests have a major influence on global patterns of biodiversity, ecosystem ecology, productivity and biogeochemical cycles, but they remain relatively understudied. Moreover, our understanding of many global patterns (e.g. of how biodiversity, ecophysiology or ecosystem function vary with latitude) are often influenced by a handful of data points from tropical latitudes (in contrast to swarms of data points from temperate regions). The result is that the wet tropics are often treated as a warm, wet ‘end-point' of most global analyses. However, comparison of tropical with extratropical regions is not straightforward, because of the vast geographical separations involved that lead to complications resulting from both biogeography and climate. The sheer size of the tropical zone implies further that comparison is necessary among tropical biomes, not just between climate zones. Here we argue that our understanding of ecosystem ecology and function can be greatly advanced by considering environmental gradients within the tropics, whether gradients of moisture or of other climate variables. In particular, the use of elevation gradients within the tropics is a particularly powerful tool to further understanding of the influence of temperature on the biodiversity, ecology, ecosystem function and global change response of forest ecosystems. Since the explorations of von Humboldt (von Humboldt {\&} Bonpland, 1805), the importance of tropical elevational gradients to biodiversity has been noted, and species distribution has been recognized to be a function of climatic and edaphic factors. Now, more than ever before, we are acutely aware that these environmental factors are likely to change at rates without recent parallel (Vuille et al., 2003; Bush et al., 2004; Urrutia {\&} Vuille, 2009). Montane forest systems are under threat of destruction and dislocation. Deepening our understanding of their composition and function is an essential step to providproviding an adequate baseline for evaluating future change. We identify five major justifications for investing effort in studying these systems.},

The relative contributions to soil C pools of roots vs. shoots is one aspect that has been mostly overlooked, although it appears a key factor that drives the fate of plant tissue C either as mineralized CO(2) or as stabilized soil organic matter (SOM). Available studies on the subject consistently indicate that root C has a longer residence time in soil than shoot C. From the few studies with complete datasets, we estimated that the mean residence time in soils of root-derived C is 2.4 times that of shoot-derived C. Our analyses indicate that this value is biased neither by an underestimation of root contributions, as exudation was considered in the analysis, nor by a priming effect of shoot litter on SOM. Here, we discuss the main SOM stabilisation mechanisms with respect to their ability to specifically protect root-derived SOM. Comparing in situ and incubation experiments suggests that the higher chemical recalcitrance of root tissues as compared to that of shoots is responsible for only a small portion, i.e. about one fourth, of the difference in mean residence time in soils of root-derived vs. shoot-derived C. This suggests that SOM protection mechanisms other than chemical recalcitrance are also enhanced by root activities: (1) physico-chemical protection, especially in deeper horizons, (2) micrometer-scale physical protection through myccorhiza and root-hair activities, and (3) chemical interactions with metal ions. The impact of environmental conditions within deeper soil layers on root C stabilisation appear difficult to assess, but is likely, if anything, to further increase the ratio between the mean residence time of root vs. shoot C in soils. Future advances are expected from isotopic studies conducted at the molecular level, which will help unravel the fate of individual shoot and root compounds, such as cutins and suberins, throughout soil profiles.},

abstract = {Understanding how oceanographic factors independently and interactively influence fish behavior, physiology, and survival is essential for predicting the impact of climate change on fish. Such predictions are especially challenging for highly migratory species such as salmon that experience a broad range of conditions. We applied a novel modeling approach that combines an individual‐based particle model with a bioenergetics model to evaluate the effects of oceanographic variability on migration of post‐smolt Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ). Interannual variability in the surface current velocity and sea surface temperature differentially influenced post‐smolt salmon migration. The magnitude, duration, and direction of the currents relative to a fish's intended swimming direction had the strongest influence on migration. Changes in ocean circulation led to changes in currents at a regional scale that have a similar, relative effect across multiple populations during out‐migration. Results of this study suggest that the Nova Scotia Coastal Current has a strong influence on the migration pathways of migrating salmon through the Gulf of Maine. The influx of cool fresh water from the Arctic, observed in the early 1990s, changed the Nova Scotia Coastal Current and, as suggested by model results, could have dramatically influenced post‐smolt salmon migration success. There was a trade‐off between arriving at the destination quickly but at a small size and not arriving at the destination at all. Fish that took a long time to migrate had more opportunities to feed and encountered warmer summer waters, increasing their overall growth.},

abstract = {Statistical species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict the potential changes in species distributions under climate change scenarios. We suggest that we need to revisit the conceptual framework and ecological assumptions on which the relationship between species distributions and environment is based. We present a simple conceptual framework to examine the selection of environmental predictors and data resolution scales. These vary widely in recent papers, with light inconsistently included in the models. Focusing on light as a necessary component of plant SDMs, we briefly review its dependence on aspect and slope and existing knowledge of its influence on plant distribution. Differences in light regimes between north- and south-facing aspects in temperate latitudes can produce differences in temperature equivalent to moves 200 km polewards. Local topography may create refugia that are not recognized in many climate change SDMs using coarse-scale data. We argue that current assumptions about the selection of predictors and data resolution need further testing. Application of these ideas can clarify many issues of scale, extent and choice of predictors, and potentially improve the use of SDMs for climate change modelling of biodiversity.},

In this study, we used a remote autonomous unbaited video system and recorded reef fish assemblages during daylight hours, 10 times a day for 34 consecutive days in a branching coral patch of the lagoon of New Caledonia. In total, 50 031 fish observations belonging to 114 taxa, 66 genera and 31 families were recorded in 256 recorded videos. Carnivores and herbivore-detritus feeders dominated the trophic structure. We found significant variations in the composition of fish assemblages between times of day. Taxa richness and fish abundance were greater in the early morning and in the late afternoon than during the day. Fourteen taxa displayed well-defined temporal patterns in abundance with one taxon influenced by time of day, six influenced by tidal state and seven influenced by both time of day and tidal state. None of these 14 taxa were piscivores, 10 were herbivore-detritus feeders, three were carnivores and one was plankton feeder. Our results suggest a diel migration from feeding grounds to shelter areas and highlight the importance of taking into account small-scale temporal variability in animal diversity and abundance when studying connectivity between habitats and monitoring communities.},

abstract = {Mangrove forests are highly productive but globally threatened coastal ecosystems, whose role in the carbon budget of the coastal zone has long been debated. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the available data on carbon fluxes in mangrove ecosystems. A reassessment of global mangrove primary production from the literature results in a conservative estimate of similar to 218 +/- 72 Tg C a(-1). When using the best available estimates of various carbon sinks (organic carbon export, sediment burial, and mineralization), it appears that {\textgreater} 50{\%} of the carbon fixed by mangrove vegetation is unaccounted for. This unaccounted carbon sink is conservatively estimated at similar to 112 +/- 85 Tg C a(-1), equivalent in magnitude to similar to 30-40{\%} of the global riverine organic carbon input to the coastal zone. Our analysis suggests that mineralization is severely underestimated, and that the majority of carbon export from mangroves to adjacent waters occurs as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). CO(2) efflux from sediments and creek waters and tidal export of DIC appear to be the major sinks. These processes are quantitatively comparable in magnitude to the unaccounted carbon sink in current budgets, but are not yet adequately constrained with the limited published data available so far.},

abstract = {We studied the changes in soil carbon contents when pastures are converted to either secondary forest or plantation forest in north-western Ecuador. At 40 sites within the region, paired pasture and forest plots were compared. We related the observed soil carbon concentrations, stocks, and changes (in the 0-0.25 m and 0.25-0.5 m layers) to land use history, climate, and soil characteristics. Variation in carbon concentrations over sites in volcanic soils could be well predicted for both pastures (R-2=0.96) and forests (R-2=0.93) on the basis of soil mineralogy, while for sedimentary soils, clearly less variation could be explained (R-2=0.14 for pastures and 0.39 for forests). The dominant factor explaining changes in carbon stocks following pasture to forest conversion was pasture age. Forests, paired with pastures less than 10 years old, had on average 9.3 Mg ha(-1) less soil carbon than the pastures, while forests paired with pastures between 20 and 30 years old had on average 18.8 Mg ha(-1) more soil carbon and forest paired with pastures older than 30 years had on average 15.8 Mg ha(-1) more carbon than the pastures. In this region, reforestation of old pastures will generally lead to an increase of soil carbon stocks. These results can be used for optimal site selection for carbon sequestration projects and for including soil carbon in the estimated benefits of these projects.},

A methodology was developed integrating atmospheric and hydrooptical radiative transfer models (MODTRAN-4, Hydrolight) to estimate the underwater light field.

A new Vemco VR2W Positioning System (VPS) is described and tested here using an array of 16 VR2W acoustic monitoring receivers and 8 fixed synchronizing transmitters. VPS positioning algorithm is based on the 3-receiver time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) algorithm used by the existing Vemco VRAP system, extended to work with an array of three or more receivers that do not have synchronized clocks. The positional accuracy and performance of the VPS was estimated on a stationary and a slow-moving coded transmitter, and on two free-swimming elasmobranch species. Mean positional accuracy (??SD) of VPS estimates from a stationary transmitter deployed at several locations within the receiver array was 2.64 ?? 2.32. m. Positional error was significantly lower inside (2.13 ?? 1.31. m) than outside the array (5.12 ?? 4.11. m; p{\textless} 0001). There were no significant differences in positional accuracy between stationary and moving tests (4.09 ?? 2.53. m; p= 0.067). Furthermore, home range estimates and movement parameters of two elasmobranch species tracked simultaneously with VPS and active tracking were statistically similar (p{\textgreater} 0.05). Our results suggest that the positional accuracy of the VPS is comparable to active tracking; however, researchers must consider specific environmental and biological variables when using the VPS. Additionally, the number, layout and proximity of acoustic receivers and synchronizing transmitters can improve considerably the performance of the VPS. The VPS provides a more efficient, less expensive approach to study and quantify fine-scale, long-term movements and habitat use of multiple individuals simultaneously, with the potential for improving our understanding on ecological and behavioral population level processes in aquatic environments. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Measurements of sap flow, stomatal conductance, leaf water potential and pressure-volume relations were obtained in Quercus lanceifolia, a canopy-dominant tree species. Our results indicate that FU occurred 34{\%} of the time and led to the recovery of 9{\%} (24 ± 9.1 L) of all the dry-season water transpired from individual branches. Capacity for FU was independently verified for seven additional common tree species. NT accounted for approximately 17{\%} (46 L) of dry-season water loss. There was a strong correlation between FU and the duration of leaf wetness events (fog and/or rain), as well as between NT and the night-time vapour pressure deficit.

abstract = {The storage and sequestration of carbon by tropical montane forests is poorly understood. We quantified the above-ground biomass (AGB) storage in secondary tropical montane forests in southern Ecuador. The AGB in older secondary ({\textgreater}40 years old) forest was found to be 158??38Mgha-1 of land surface at 1000 m elevation and 104??25Mgha-1 of land surface at 2250 m elevation. This is less than the storage reported in a recent synthesis of AGB observations in mature tropical montane forests, potentially due to a legacy of selective logging within our study sites. The slope angle resulted in AGB being 1.5-10{\%} greater when reported on a planimetric compared to land surface area basis. We also quantified AGB in areas of abandoned pasture where grazing and fire had been excluded. Pasture that had been recently abandoned (1-2years) stored 2-18Mgha-1 of AGB with the higher values due to the presence of relict trees. Re-growing secondary forests, established through natural regeneration, accumulated AGB at a rate of 10Mgha-1yr-1 at 1000 m elevation and 4Mgha-1yr-1 at 2250m elevation, for the first 5-7years after pasture abandonment. After 12-15 years, accumulation of AGB slowed to 1-2Mgha-1yr-1. Net biomass accumulation rates were similar to those observed in lowland humid tropical forests, suggesting that regenerating tropical montane forests provide an important carbon sequestration. In newly regenerating forests, small trees (DBH {\textless} 10cm) contributed up to 50{\%} of total AGB. In the older secondary forest at high elevation coarse dead wood contributed 34{\%} of total AGB.},

Thanks to early expeditions on the$\backslash$nAtlantic Ocean by the Danish biologist Johannes Schmidt who found$\backslash$nsmall ({\textless} 10mm) leptocephali larvae in the Sargasso Sea about 100$\backslash$nyears ago, we have now a strong indication where the spawning site$\backslash$nfor this species is located. The American eel (Anguilla rostrata,$\backslash$nLeSueur) also spawns in the Sargasso Sea. The spawning time and location$\backslash$nof both species have been supported and refined in recent analyses$\backslash$nof the available historical data. Subsequent ichthyoplankton surveys$\backslash$nconducted by McCleave (USA) and Tesch (Germany) in the 1980s indicated$\backslash$nan increase in the number of leptocephali {\textless} 10 mm , confirming and$\backslash$nrefining the Sargasso Sea theory of Johannes Schmidt. Distinctions$\backslash$nbetween the European and American eel are based on morphological$\backslash$ncharacteristics (number of vertebrae) as well as molecular markers$\backslash$n(allozymes, mitochondrial DNA and anonymous genomic-DNA. Although$\backslash$nrecognised as two distinct species, it remains unclear which mechanisms$\backslash$nplay a role in species separation during larval drift, and what orientation$\backslash$nmechanism eels use during migration in the open sea. The current$\backslash$nstatus of knowledge on these issues will be presented. The hypothesis$\backslash$nthat all European eel migrate to the Sargasso Sea for reproduction$\backslash$nand comprise a single randomly mating population, the so called panmixia$\backslash$ntheory, was until recently broadly accepted. However, based on field$\backslash$nobservations, morphological parameters and molecular studies there$\backslash$nare some indications that Schmidt's claim of complete homogeneity$\backslash$nof the European eel population and a unique spawning location may$\backslash$nbe an overstatement. Recent molecular work on European eel indicated$\backslash$na genetic mosaic consisting of several isolated groups, leading to$\backslash$na rejection of the panmixia theory. Nevertheless, the latest extensive$\backslash$ngenetic survey indicated that the geographical component of genetic$\backslash$nstructure lacked temporal stability, emphasising the need for temporal$\backslash$nreplication in the study of highly vagile marine species. Induced$\backslash$nspawning of hormone treated eels in the aquarium was collective and$\backslash$nsimultaneous. In this work for the first time group spawning behaviour$\backslash$nhas ever been observed and recorded in eels. Studies in swim-tunnels$\backslash$nindicate that eels can swim four to six times more efficiently than$\backslash$nnon-anguilliform fish such as trout. After a laboratory swim trial$\backslash$nof eels over 5,500 km, the body composition did not change and fat,$\backslash$nprotein and carbohydrate were used in the same proportion. This study$\backslash$ndemonstrated for the first time that European eel are physiologically$\backslash$nable of reaching the Sargasso Sea without feeding. Based on catches$\backslash$nof newly hatched larvae, temperature preference tests and telemetry$\backslash$ntracking of mature hormone treated animals, it can be hypothesised$\backslash$nthat spawning in the Sargasso Sea is collective and simultaneous,$\backslash$nwhile presumably taking place in the upper 200 m of the ocean. Successful$\backslash$nsatellite tracking of longfin female eels in New Zealand has been$\backslash$nperformed to monitor migration pathways. Implementation of this new$\backslash$ntechnology is possible in this species because it is three times$\backslash$nlarger than the European eel. In the future, miniaturisation of tagging$\backslash$ntechnology may allow European eels to be tracked in time by satellite.$\backslash$nThe most interesting potential contribution of telemetry tracking$\backslash$nof silver eels is additional knowledge about migration routes, rates,$\backslash$nand depths. In combination with catches of larvae in the Sargasso$\backslash$nSea, it may elucidate the precise spawninglocations of different$\backslash$neel species or groups. Only then, we will be able to define sustainable$\backslash$nmanagement issues by integrating this novel knowledge into spawners$\backslash$nescapement and juvenile fishing quota. },

abstract = {Water-bound nitrogen (N) cycling in temperate terrestrial ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere is today mainly inorganic because of anthropogenic release of reactive N to the environment. In little-industrialized and remote areas, in contrast, a larger part of N cycling occurs as dissolved organic N (DON). In a north Andean tropical montane forest in Ecuador, the N cycle changed markedly during 1998-2010 along with increasing N deposition and reduced soil moisture. The DON concentrations and the fractional contribution of DON to total N significantly decreased in rainfall, throughfall, and soil solutions. This inorganic turn of the N cycle was most pronounced in rainfall and became weaker along the flow path of water through the system until it disappeared in stream water. Decreasing organic contributions to N cycling were caused not only by increasing inorganic N input but also by reduced DON production and/or enhanced DON decomposition. Accelerated DON decomposition might be attributable to less waterlogging and higher nutrient availability. Significantly increasing NO3-N concentrations and NO3-N/NH4-N concentration ratios in throughfall and litter leachate below the thick organic layers indicated increasing nitrification. In mineral soil solutions, in contrast, NH4-N concentrations increased and NO3-N/NH4-N concentration ratios decreased significantly, suggesting increasing net ammonification. Our results demonstrate that the remote tropical montane forests on the rim of the Amazon basin experienced a pronounced change of the N cycle in only one decade. This change likely parallels a similar change which followed industrialization in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere more than a century ago.},

SUMMARY (1) This paper on mineral cycling in lower montane rain forest at an altitude of 2400-2500 m in the Eastern Highlands of New Guinea presents data on rainfall and throughfall, and on the quantities of N, P, K, Ca and Mg reaching the forest floor in rain, throughfall and litter fall. The quantities of these minerals in the litter layer have also been measured. Samples were collected from four sites in contrasting topographical situations. (2) The average throughfall on the four sites was 68 + 3.4{\%} (S.E.) of the rainfall (3960 mm in 1969; 4010 mm in 1970). Stemflow was less than 1{\%} of throughfall. (3) The estimated quantities (kg ha-' yr-1) of minerals in the rainfall were 6.5 N, 0 53 P, 7.3 K, 3.6 Ca and 1.3 Mg, and the mean quantities leached from the canopy on the four sites were 29.6 N, 2-5 P, 71.1 K, 19.0 Ca and 10.9 Mg. The mean returns of minerals in the litter fall were 90.8 N, 5. 1 P, 27.8 K, 94.7 Ca and 19.2 Mg. The return of minerals in throughfall and litter fall was remarkably similar on the four sites but certain minor between-site differences are discussed. (4) The quantities of minerals in the standing crop of litter on the forest floor (mean 6.46 t ha-) were (kg ha-) 91 N, 4.8 P, 11.5 K, 96 Ca and 14.5 Mg. (5) Comparisons are made with mineral cycling studies on other tropical forest sites, and some general conclusions are drawn concerning the differences in nutrient turnover in lowland and montane rain forests. It appears that the amounts of P, K, Ca and Mg returned annually in the throughfall and litter of montane forests overlap with the values found in lowland forest, but the return of nitrogen is lower. This presents particular problems of interpretation in view of the huge amounts of nitrogen present in the soil of the montane forest, and the substantial amounts in the annual throughfall. It is concluded that nitrogen is probably fixed in the phyllosphere and becomes immobilized in the soil and so is unavailable to plants.},

abstract = {Evergreen broad-leaved tropical forests can have high rates of productivity and large accumulations of carbon in plant biomass and soils. They can therefore play an important role in the global carbon cycle, influencing atmospheric CO2 concentrations if climate warms. We applied meta-analyses to published data to evaluate the apparent effects of temperature on carbon fluxes and storages in mature, moist tropical evergreen forest ecosystems. Among forests, litter production, tree growth, and belowground carbon allocation all increased significantly with site mean annual temperature (MAT); total net primary productivity (NPP) increased by an estimated 0.2-0.7 Mg C x ha(-1) x yr(-1) x degrees C(-1). Temperature had no discernible effect on the turnover rate of aboveground forest biomass, which averaged 0.014 yr(-1) among sites. Consistent with these findings, forest biomass increased with site MAT at a rate of 5-13 Mg C x ha(-1) x degrees C(-1). Despite greater productivity in warmer forests, soil organic matter accumulations decreased with site MAT, with a slope of -8 Mg C x ha(-1) x degrees C(-1), indicating that decomposition rates of soil organic matter increased with MAT faster than did rates of NPP. Turnover rates of surface litter also increased with temperature among forests. We found no detectable effect of temperature on total carbon storage among moist-tropical evergreen forests, but rather a shift in ecosystem structure, from low-biomass forests with relatively large accumulations of detritus in cooler sites, to large-biomass forests with relatively smaller detrital stocks in warmer locations. These results imply that, in a warmer climate, conservation of forest biomass will be critical to the maintenance of carbon stocks in moist tropical forests.},

abstract = {To facilitate decision support in freshwater ecosystem protection and restoration management, habitat suitability models can be very valuable. Data driven methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are particularly useful in this context, seen their time-efficient development and relatively high reliability. However, specialized and technical literature on neural network modelling offers a variety of model development criteria to select model architecture, training procedure, etc. This may lead to confusion among ecosystem modellers and managers regarding the optimal training and validation methodology. This paper focuses on the analysis of ANN development and application for predicting macroinvertebrate communities, a species group commonly used in freshwater assessment worldwide. This review reflects on the different aspects regarding model development and application based on a selection of 26 papers reporting the use of ANN models for the prediction of macroinvertebrates. This analysis revealed that the applied model training and validation methodologies can often be improved and moreover crucial steps in the modelling process are often poorly documented. Therefore, suggestions to improve model development, assessment and application in ecological river management are presented. In particular, data pre-processing determines to a high extent the reliability of the induced models and their predictive relevance. This also counts for the validation criteria, that need to be better tuned to the practical simulation requirements. Moreover, the use of sensitivity methods can help to extract knowledge on the habitat preference of species and allow peer-review by ecological experts. The selection of relevant input variables remains a critical challenge as well. Model coupling is a missing crucial step to link human activities, hydrology, physical habitat conditions, water quality and ecosystem status. This last aspect is probably the most valuable aspect to enable decision support in water management based on ANN models.},

Copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and lingcod (Ophiodon enlongatus) are dominant members of the typical reef fish community that inhabit rocky and high-relief substrates along the Pacific Northwest. We used acoustic telemetry to document their residency and movements in the nearshore waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska in order to assess use of created reef habitat in an individual-based manner. A total of 57 fish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Forty-five fish were captured and monitored in three habitats: artificial reef, low-relief natural reef, and patchy high-relief natural reef. Within each habitat, both rockfish and lingcod exhibited long periods of residency with limited movements. Twelve rockfish were captured at the natural reefs and displaced a distance of 4.0 km to the artificial reef. Five of the 12 rockfish returned within 10 d of their release to their initial capture site. Another five of the 12 displaced fish established residency at the artificial reef through the duration of our study. Our results suggest the potential for artificial reefs to provide rockfish habitat in the event of disturbances to natural habitat.},

abstract = {Adaptations that reduce water retention on leaf surfaces may increase photosynthetic capacity of cloud forests because carbon dioxide diffuses slower in water than air. Leaf water repellency was examined in three distinct ecosystems to test the hypothesis that tropical montane cloud forest species have a higher degree of leaf water repellency than species from tropical dry forests and species from temperate foothills-grassland vegetation. Leaf water repellency was measured by calculating the contact angle of the leaf surface and the line tangent to a water droplet through the point of contact on the adaxial and the abaxial surface. Leaf water repellency was significantly different between the three study areas. The hypothesis that leaf water repellency is higher in cloud forest species than tropical dry forests and temperate foothills-grassland vegetation was not confirmed in this study. Leaf water repellency was lower for cloud forest species (adaxial surface = 50.8°; abaxial surface = 82.9°) than tropical dry forest species (adaxial surface = 74.5°; abaxial surface = 87.3°) and temperate foothills-grassland species (adaxial surface = 77.6°; abaxial surface = 95.8°). The low values of leaf water repellency in cloud forest species may be influenced by presence of epiphylls and loss of epicuticular wax on the leaf surfaces.},

abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (habitat models) relate the occurrence or abundance of a species to environmental and/or geographical predictors that then allow predictions to be mapped across an entire region. These models are used in a range of policy settings such as managing greenhouse gases, biosecurity threats and conservation planning. Prediction errors are almost ubiquitous in habitat models. An understanding of the source, magnitude and pattern of these errors is essential if the models are to be used transparently in decision making. This study considered the sources of errors in habitat models. It divided them into two main classes, error resulting from data deficiencies and error introduced by the specification of the model. Common and important data errors included missing covariates, and samples of species' occurrences that were small, biased or lack absences. These affected the types of models that could be developed and the probable errors that would occur. Almost all models had missing covariates, and this introduced significant spatial correlation in the errors of the analysis. A challenging aspect of modelling is that species' distributions are affected by processes operating in both environmental and geographical space. We differentiated between global (aspatial) and local (spatial) errors, and discussed how they arise and what can be done to alleviate their effects. Synthesis and applications. This study brings together statistical and ecological thinking to consider the appropriate techniques for habitat modelling. Ecological theory suggests models capable of defining optima, while allowing for interactions between variables. Statistical considerations, including impacts of data errors, suggest models that deal with multimodality and discontinuity in response surfaces. Models are typically simple approximations of the true probability surface. We suggest the use of flexible regression techniques, and explain what makes such methods superior for ecological modelling. The most robust modelling approaches are likely to be those in which care is taken to match the model with knowledge of ecology, and in which each is allowed to inform the other.

abstract = {The concentration, stoichiometry and resorption of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in plant leaves are often used as proxies of the availability of these growth-limiting nutrients, but the responses of these metrics to changes in nutrient availability remain largely untested for tropical forest trees. We evaluated changes in N and P concentrations, N/P ratios and resorption for four common tree species after 13 years of factorial N and P additions in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. Chronic P addition increased foliar P concentrations, decreased P resorption proficiency and decreased N/P ratios in three locally common eudicot tree species (Alseis blackiana, Heisteria concinna, Tetragastris panamensis). The increase in foliar P involved similar proportional increases in organic and inorganic P in two species and a disproportionately large increase in inorganic P in A. blackiana. Nitrogen addition did not alter foliar N concentrations in any species, but did decrease N resorption proficiency in H. concinna. A fourth species, the palm Oenocarpus mapora, demonstrated remarkably static foliar nutrient concentrations, responding only with a marginal decrease in P resorption proficiency under N plus P co-addition. Synthesis. Collectively, these results suggest that adjustment of N/P ratios can be expected in eudicots exposed to elevated P, but foliar N appears to already be at optimal levels in these lowland rain forest tree species. The complexity of species-specific responses to altered nutrient availability highlights the difficulty in predicting future responses of tropical forest trees to a changing world.

We discuss the intrinsic discrete nature of some of the factors appearing in the field equations, underlining the exception represented by the constitutive term, the discretization of which is maintained as the key issue for numerical methods devoted to field problems. We propose a systematic technique to perform this task, present a rationale for the adoption of two dual discretization grids and point out some optimization opportunities in the combined selection of interpolation functions and cell geometry for the finite volume method. Finally, we suggest an explanation for the intrinsic limitations of the classical finite difference method in the construction of accurate high order formulas for field problems.},

abstract = {"Horchata" is a vegetable milk obtained from tiger nuts. The solid waste from horchata production was analyzed for physicochemical and microbial properties, aiming to determine its potential use as a fiber source for the food industry. The solid waste contains a high proportion of total dietary fiber (59.71 g/100 g), composed mainly of insoluble dietary fiber (99.8{\%}). It has a high water-holding capacity (8.01 g/g) and oil-holding capacity (6.92 g/g) and a low water absorption (1.79 g/g) and water adsorption (0.23 g/g) capacities, in comparison with other dietary fiber sources. The emulsifying ability was 70.33 mL/100 mL, and the wastes showed high emulsion stability (100 mL/100 mL). The physicochemical properties indicate that tiger nut byproducts are rich in fiber and may be considered a potential ingredient in a healthy diet. However, the microbial quality was poor, meaning that it must be pasteurized prior to its addition to any food product.},

abstract = {How tropical rainforests are responding to the ongoing global changes in atmospheric composition and climate is little studied and poorly understood. Although rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) could enhance forest productivity, increased temperatures and drought are likely to diminish it. The limited field data have produced conflicting views of the net impacts of these changes so far. One set of studies has seemed to point to enhanced carbon uptake; however, questions have arisen about these findings, and recent experiments with tropical forest trees indicate carbon saturation of canopy leaves and no biomass increase under enhanced CO2. Other field observations indicate decreased forest productivity and increased tree mortality in recent years of peak temperatures and drought (strong El Ni{\~{n}}o episodes). To determine current climatic responses of forests around the world tropics will require careful annual monitoring of ecosystem performance in representative forests. To develop the necessary process-level understanding of these responses will require intensified experimentation at the whole-tree and stand levels. Finally, a more complete understanding of tropical rainforest carbon cycling is needed for determining whether these ecosystems are carbon sinks or sources now, and how this status might change during the next century.},

However, the extent to which this paradigm applies to belowground processes remains unresolved. We measured indices of soil microbial nutrient status in lowland, sub-montane and montane tropical forests along a natural gradient spanning 3400 m in elevation in the Peruvian Andes. With increasing elevation there were marked increases in soil concentrations of total N, total P, and readily-extractable P, but a decrease in N mineralization determined by in situ resin bags. Microbial carbon (C) and N increased with increasing elevation, but microbial C:N:P ratios were relatively constant, suggesting homeostasis. The activity of hydrolytic enzymes, which are rich in N, decreased with increasing elevation, while the ratios of enzymes involved in the acquisition of N and P increased with increasing elevation, further indicating a shift in the relative demand for N and P by microbial biomass. We conclude that soil microorganisms shift investment in nutrient acquisition from P to N between lowland and montane tropical forests, suggesting that different nutrients regulate soil microbial metabolism and the soil carbon balance in these ecosystems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Determining species distributions accurately is crucial to developing conservation and management strategies for imperiled species, but a challenging task for small populations. We evaluated the efficacy of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for improving detection and thus potentially refining the known distribution of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Methow and Okanogan Subbasins of the Upper Columbia River, which span the border between Washington, USA and British Columbia, Canada. We developed an assay to target a 90 base pair sequence of Chinook DNA and used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to quantify the amount of Chinook eDNA in triplicate 1-L water samples collected at 48 stream locations in June and again in August 2012. The overall probability of detecting Chinook with our eDNA method in areas within the known distribution was 0.77 (±0.05. SE). Detection probability was lower in June (0.62, ±0.08. SE) during high flows and at the beginning of spring Chinook migration than during base flows in August (0.93, ±0.04. SE). In the Methow subbasin, mean eDNA concentration was higher in August compared to June, especially in smaller tributaries, probably resulting from the arrival of spring Chinook adults, reduced discharge, or both. Chinook eDNA concentrations did not appear to change in the Okanogan subbasin from June to August. Contrary to our expectations about downstream eDNA accumulation, Chinook eDNA did not decrease in concentration in upstream reaches (0-120. km). Further examination of factors influencing spatial distribution of eDNA in lotic systems may allow for greater inference of local population densities along stream networks or watersheds. These results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of eDNA detection methods for determining landscape-level distribution of anadromous salmonids in large river systems.},

We used plastic minnow traps (PM), metal minnow traps (MM) and two types of fyke nets differing in mesh size (F1, small meshed; F2, large meshed) to capture over 12,000 fish belonging to 11 species. Over 97{\%} of captured fish were Andalusian toothcarp (Aphanius baeticus), Iberian loach (Cobitis paludica) and sand smelt (Atherina boyeri). F1 was the most efficient trap type in capturing the three most abundant species. Catches by PM and F2 differed in taxonomic composition, the former being characterised by toothcarp and loach dominance and the latter by the catch of eel (Anguilla anguilla) and grey mullets (Fam. Mugilidae). There were large differences in the size of fish captured in each trap type, with fish size following the pattern F2 {\textgreater} MM {\textgreater} F1 {\textgreater} PM. Small juveniles of the three dominant species were captured only in PM, thus enabling us to follow their seasonal size variation. However, PM traps were inefficient for sand smelt sampling and failed to catch large individuals of this species. This schooling and mainly pelagic species was more accurately monitored through the use of F1. Our results suggest that a combination of PM and F1 traps could improve the efficacy of small fish sampling in streams. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Enhanced plant biomass accumulation in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration could dampen the future rate of increase in CO2 levels and associated climate warming. However, it is unknown whether CO2-induced stimulation of plant growth and biomass accumulation will be sustained or whether limited nitrogen (N) availability constrains greater plant growth in a CO2-enriched world. Here we show, after a six-year field study of perennial grassland species grown under ambient and elevated levels of CO2 and N, that low availability of N progressively suppresses the positive response of plant biomass to elevated CO2. Initially, the stimulation of total plant biomass by elevated CO2 was no greater at enriched than at ambient N supply. After four to six years, however, elevated CO2 stimulated plant biomass much less under ambient than enriched N supply. This response was consistent with the temporally divergent effects of elevated CO2 on soil and plant N dynamics at differing levels of N supply. Our results indicate that variability in availability of soil N and deposition of atmospheric N are both likely to influence the response of plant biomass accumulation to elevated atmospheric CO2. Given that limitations to productivity resulting from the insufficient availability of N are widespread in both unmanaged and managed vegetation, soil N supply is probably an important constraint on global terrestrial responses to elevated CO2.},

abstract = {Although often overlooked in forest research, the canopy can play an important role in forest nutrient cycling. Since the canopy is spatially isolated from the forest floor, nutrient cycling in the two areas may differ as terrestrial nutrients accumulate. We measured rates of free-living N2 fixation along an elevation gradient (1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 m) of tropical montane canopy soils, compared these to rates measured in the top 5 cm of forest floor soils (excluding fresh litter), and assessed the effects of elevated nutrient inputs to the forest floor. N2 fixation was measured using the acetylene reduction assay. Measurements occurred in the field, in the wet and dry seasons, using intact cores of soil. The forest floor had been fertilized biannually with moderate amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) for 4 years; treatments included control, N, P and N + P. N2 fixation rates exhibited little variation with elevation but were higher in the dry season than the wet season. Fixation was inhibited in forest floor N plots compared to control and P plots, and stimulated in canopy P plots compared to control. At 2,000 m, the canopy contributed 12 {\%} of measured canopy and forest floor N2 fixation (1.2 kg N ha−1year−1). Results suggest that N2 fixation is an active process in canopy soils, which is variable across seasons and sensitive to changes in terrestrial nutrient availability. Long-term terrestrial accumulation of N and/or P has the potential to significantly change the dynamics of soil N cycling in these canopies.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that nitrogen in most tropical forests is relatively more available than N in most temperate forests, and even that it may function as an excess nutrient in many tropical forests. If this is correct, tropical forests should have more open N cycles than temperate forests, with both inputs and outputs of N large relative to N cycling within systems. Consequent differences in both the magnitude and the pathways of N loss imply that tropical forests should in general be more 15 N enriched than are most temperate forests. In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the nitrogen stable isotopic composition of tree leaves and soils from a variety of tropical and temperate forests. Foliar d 15 N values from tropical forests averaged 6.5‰ higher than from temperate forests. Within the tropics, ecosystems with relatively low N availability (montane forests, forests on sandy soils) were significantly more depleted in 15 N than other tropical forests. The average d 15 N values for tropical forest soils, either for surface or for depth samples, were almost 8‰ higher than temperate forest soils. These results provide another line of evidence that N is relatively abundant in many tropical forest ecosystems.},

Overexploitation and climate variability impact the abundance and distribution of top predators in ocean ecosystems. Improved understanding of ecological patterns, evolutionary constraints and ecosystem function is critical for preventing extinctions, loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystem services. Recent advances in electronic tagging techniques have provided the capacity to observe the movements and long-distance migrations of animals in relation to ocean processes across a range of ecological scales. Tagging of Pacific Predators, a field programme of the Census of Marine Life, deployed 4,306 tags on 23 species in the North Pacific Ocean, resulting in a tracking data set of unprecedented scale and species diversity that covers 265,386 tracking days from 2000 to 2009. Here we report migration pathways, link ocean features to multispecies hotspots and illustrate niche partitioning within and among congener guilds. Our results indicate that the California Current large marine ecosystem and the North Pacific transition zone attract and retain a diverse assemblage of marine vertebrates. Within the California Current large marine ecosystem, several predator guilds seasonally undertake north-south migrations that may be driven by oceanic processes, species-specific thermal tolerances and shifts in prey distributions. We identify critical habitats across multinational boundaries and show that top predators exploit their environment in predictable ways, providing the foundation for spatial management of large marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {* Analyses of animal resource selection functions (RSF) using data collected from relocations of individuals via remote telemetry devices have become commonplace. Increasing technological advances, however, have produced statistical challenges in analysing such highly autocorrelated data. Weighted distribution methods have been proposed for analysing RSFs with telemetry data. However, they can be computationally challenging due to an intractable normalizing constant and cannot be aggregated (i.e. collapsed) over time to make space-only inference. * In this study, we take a conceptually different approach to modelling animal telemetry data for making RSF inference. We consider the telemetry data to be a realization of a space–time point process. Under the point process paradigm, the times of the relocations are also considered to be random rather than fixed. * We show the point process models we propose are a generalization of the weighted distribution telemetry models. By generalizing the weighted model, we can access several numerical techniques for evaluating point process likelihoods that make use of common statistical software. Thus, the analysis methods can be readily implemented by animal ecologists. * In addition to ease of computation, the point process models can be aggregated over time by marginalizing over the temporal component of the model. This allows a full range of models to be constructed for RSF analysis at the individual movement level up to the study area level. * To demonstrate the analysis of telemetry data with the point process approach, we analysed a data set of telemetry locations from northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska. Both a space–time and an aggregated space-only model were fitted. At the individual level, the space–time analysis showed little selection relative to the habitat covariates. However, at the study area level, the space-only model showed strong selection relative to the covariates.},

An iterative regression scheme using coregistered, temporally coincident, daily composites of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder SST data is used to scale the TM digital numbers in each scene to SST, approximating an atmospheric correction. This approach provides temporally concurrent match-ups, even for Landsat scenes more than 10 years old and over 1000 data points to most regressions. Analysis of the TM scenes by year-day delivers temporal resolution sufficient for insight into overall seasonal pattern and allows identification of recurring seasonal features within the study area. The dominant seasonal patterns is a cross-shelf SST gradient of coldest water nearshore in winter which reverses sign in summer and disappears in spring and fall. Differences in summer SST are evident between four adjacent bays, attributable to differences in residual circulation, freshwater input, and flushing. Recurrent frontal zones evident in summer are identified and compare well to available but noncoincident in situ hydrographic data. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Internal production of organic acids, in combination with low weathering, caused highly acidic soil waters (pH 300 on mass weight basis) due to efficient P recycling and unexpectedly high N throughputs (4-9 kg N(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1)) by either N fixation and/or N deposition.},

abstract = {Some marine species have been shown to target foraging at particular hotspots of high prey abundance. However, we show here that in the year after a nesting season, female leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Atlantic generally spend relatively little time in fixed hotspots, especially those with a surface signature revealed in satellite imagery, but rather tend to have a pattern of near continuous traveling. Associated with this traveling, distinct changes in dive behavior indicate that turtles constantly fine tune their foraging behavior and diel activity patterns in association with local conditions. Switches between nocturnal vs. diurnal activity are rare in the animal kingdom but may be essential for survival on a diet of gelatinous zooplankton where patches of high prey availability are rare. These results indicate that in their first year after nesting, leatherback turtles do not fit the general model of migration where responses to resources are suppressed during transit. However, their behavior may be different in their sabbatical years away from nesting beaches. Our results highlight the importance of whole-ocean fishing gear regulations to minimize turtle bycatch.},

abstract = {The freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla, which are catadromous, migrate between freshwater growth habitats and offshore spawning areas. A number of recent studies, however, found examples of the temperate species Anguilla anguilla, Anguilla rostrata, Anguilla japonica, Anguilla australis and Anguilla dieffenbachii that have never migrated into fresh water, spending their entire life history in the ocean. Furthermore, those studies found an intermediate type between marine and freshwater residents, which appear to frequently move between different environments during their growth phase. The discovery of marine and brackish-water residents Anguilla spp. suggests that they do not all have to be catadromous, and it calls into question the generalized classification of diadromous fishes. There has been little available information, however, concerning migration in tropical Anguilla spp. Anguilla marmorata, shows three fluctuation patterns: (1) continuous residence in fresh water, (2) continuous residence in brackish water and (3) residence in fresh water after recruitment, while returning to brackish water. Such migratory patterns were found in other tropical species, Anguilla bicolor bicolor and Anguilla bicolor pacifica. In A. b. bicolor collected in a coastal lagoon of Indonesia, two further patterns of habitat use were found: (1) constantly living in either brackish water or sea water with no freshwater life and (2) habitat shift from fresh water to brackish water or sea water. The wide range of environmental habitat use indicates that migratory behaviour of tropical Anguilla spp. is facultative among fresh, brackish and marine waters during their growth phases after recruitment to the coastal areas. Further, the migratory behaviours of tropical Anguilla spp. appear to differ in each habitat in response to inter and intra-specific competition. The results suggest that tropical Anguilla spp. have a flexible pattern of migration, with an ability to adapt to various habitats and salinities. The ability of anguillids to reside in environments of various salinities would be a common feature between tropical and temperate species without a latitudinal cline. Thus, the migration of Anguilla spp. into fresh water is clearly not an obligatory behaviour. This evidence of geographical variability among Anguilla spp. suggests that habitat use is determined by environmental conditions in each site.},

abstract = {Nitrogen deposition is projected to increase rapidly in tropical ecosystems, but changes in soil-N-cycling processes in tropical ecosystems under elevated N input are less well understood. We used N-addition experiments to achieve N-enriched conditions in mixed-species, lowland and montane forests in Panama. Our objectives were to (1) assess changes in soil mineral N production (gross rates of N mineralization and nitrification) and retention (microbial immobilization and rapid reactions to organic N) during 1- and 9-yr N additions in the lowland forest and during 1-yr N addition in the montane forest and (2) relate these changes to N leaching and N-oxide emissions. In the old-growth lowland forest located on an Inceptisol, with high base saturation and net primary production not limited by N, there was no immediate effect of first-year N addition on gross rates of mineral-N production and N-oxide emissions. Changes in soil-N processes were only apparent in chronic (9 yr) N-addition plots: gross N mineralization and nitrification rates, NO3- leaching, and N-oxide emissions increased, while microbial biomass and NH4+ immobilization rates decreased compared to the control. Increased mineral-N production under chronic N addition was paralleled by increased substrate quality (e.g., reduced C:N ratios of litterfall), while the decrease in microbial biomass was possibly due to an increase in soil acidity. An increase in N losses was reflected in the increase in 15N signatures of litterfall under chronic N addition. In contrast, the old-growth montane forest located on an Andisol, with low base saturation and aboveground net primary production limited by N, reacted to first-year N addition with increases in gross rates of mineral-N production, microbial biomass, NO3- leaching, and N-oxide emissions compared to the control. The increased N-oxide emissions were attributed to increased nitrification activity in the organic layer, and the high NO3- availability combined with the high rainfall on this sandy loam soil facilitated the instantaneous increase in NO3-leaching. These results suggest that soil type, presence of an organic layer, changes in soil-N cycling, and hydrological properties are more important indicators than vegetation as an N sink on how tropical forests respond to elevated N input.},

abstract = {Both the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and European eel (Anguilla anguilla) undertake long-distance migrations from continental waters to their spawning sites in the Sargasso Sea. Their migration routes and orientation mechanisms remain a mystery. A biophysical particle tracking model was used in this study to simulate their oceanic migration from two release areas: off the Scotian Shelf (Canada) and off the Irish continental shelf. Two plausible swimming-directed behaviours were considered for simulating two different migratory paths: true navigation to specific spawning sites and innate compass orientation towards the vast spawning area. Several combinations of swimming speeds and depths were tested to assess the effect of ocean circulation on resulting migratory pathways of virtual eels (v-eels), environmental conditions experienced along their oceanic migration, and energy consumption. Simulations show that the spawning area can be reached in time by constantly swimming and following a readjusted heading (true navigation) or a constant heading (compass orientation) even at the lowest swimming speed tested (0.2 m s-1) for most v-eels. True navigation might not be necessary to reach the spawning area. The ocean currents affect mainly the migration of American v-eels, particularly for swimming speeds lower than 0.8 m s-1. The ocean circulation increases the variability in the oceanic migration and generally reduces the efficiency of the v-eels, although positive effects can be possible for certain individuals. The depth range of diel vertical migration (DVM) significantly affects the total energy expenditure due to the water temperature experienced at the various depths. Model results also suggest that energy would not be a limiting factor as v-eels constantly swimming at 0.8 BL s-1 spent {\textless}25 and 42{\%} of energy available for migration for American and European v-eels, respectively.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

abstract = {Understanding animal home ranges and other patterns of space utilisation is an important component of spatial ecology. It allows researchers to explore and explain site occupation and habitat preferences, and also interaction and avoidance behaviour. Conventional analyses of animal home ranges use points at which the animals are observed, sometimes weighted by the time difference between sequential observations. This creates an issue in that the analysis can assign undue weight to a sample point with a long time delay from the previous observation, as the full path from the preceding point is implicitly assigned to that point. Conventional analyses also do not take into account physical constraints such as boundaries (e.g. rivers, roads, cliffs) or the cost of traversing alternate possible paths between points, typically inferring a straight-line path between sequential samples. This conventional approach has obvious limitations, especially in constrained environments such as for fish in rivers and estuaries. These limitations can be attributed in large part to a lack of available software tools. In this paper we describe a software tool we have developed that calculates kernel density estimates of occupation times by using the per-segment transit times along a path inferred using a cost surface that is constrained to remain between defined boundaries. To illustrate the functionality of the tool we use a data set of Argyrosomus japonicus (Mulloway) movements, an estuarine fish species, sampled from the Georges River estuary in Sydney, NSW. The approach is, however, generic and can be applied to any environment where animal movements are constrained, for example fragmented agricultural landscapes. The tool is written using},

In synthesizing data from over 6000 soil samples, we show strong global relationships among soil N isotopes, mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and the concentrations of organic carbon and clay in soil. In both hot ecosystems and dry ecosystems, soil organic matter was more enriched in 15 Nthan in corresponding cold ecosystems or wet ecosystems. Below aMATof 9.86C, soil d15 Nwas invariant with MAT. At the global scale, soil organic C concentrations also declined with increasing MAT and decreasing MAP.

Existing areas of suitable elephant habitat need to be protected not only from human development but from the elephants themselves. As most elephant populations in South Africa are enclosed and multiplying, there is some increasing cause for concern as the damage caused will escalate and could reach unsustainable proportions. This study examined the utilization of satellite images for the detection of elephant induced ecosystem modification. A pilot study was conducted on four medium sized Game Reserves (each ±30 000 ha) in South Africa. The aim was to ascertain the feasibility of using image analysis as instrument by which Game Reserve managers could assess biodiversity richness, habitat loss, and population-habitat viability. NDVI as indicator of primary production in vegetation is one of the instruments used to evaluate whether the carrying capacity for elephants of each Game Reserve has been reached and to compare the current biomass with those of previous years. The study also looked at the use of the woody canopy cover as target for change detection analysis. Spectral characteristics of specific trees species which are known for being preferred by elephants were used to conduct a temporal analysis on satellite images starting from the period when the elephants were re-introduced into each Game Reserve, thus attempting to identify possible impact on the biodiversity of the respective Game Reserves. Images from satellites such as Landsat, SPOT, Quickbird and SumbandilaSAT provided the needed data and maps.},

However, the soil C response to climate change is highly uncertain in these models1,2 and they omit key biogeochemical mechanisms3–5. Specifically, the traditional approach in ESMs lacks direct microbial control over soil C dynamics6–8. Thus, we tested a new model that explicitly represents microbial mechanisms of soil C cycling on the global scale. Compared with traditional models, the microbial model simulates soil C pools that more closely match contemporary observations. It also projects a much wider range of soil C responses to climate change over the twenty-first century. Global soils accumulate C if microbial growth efficiency declines with warming in the microbial model. If growth efficiency adapts to warming, the microbial model projects large soil C losses. By comparison, traditional models project modest soil C losses with global warming. Microbes also change the soil response to increased C inputs, as might occur with CO2 or nutrient fertilization. In the microbial model, microbes consume these additional inputs; whereas in traditional models, additional inputs lead to C storage. Our results indicate that ESMs should simulate microbial physiology to more accurately project climate change feedbacks.},

abstract = {Long-term, fisheries-independent bag seine surveys conducted in TX, USA estuaries from 1977 to 2009 were used to develop a spatio-temporal species-environment model for juvenile spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulous. Relationships between environmental predictors and juvenile spotted seatrout distribution were investigated using boosted regression trees (BRTs). Results showed good model performance and suggested that, in relation to environmental factors, juvenile spotted seatrout distribution is most closely linked to salinity, temperature, and distance from tidal inlets. There was also a strong seasonal pattern where abundance increased from May to October and declined precipitously after November. Juveniles were rarely captured between January and April. By interpolating the environmental predictors, monthly maps of the probability of capture were produced using ordinary kriging. Spatial patterns were also evident. Probability of occurrence began increasing first in Upper Laguna Madre peaking in Baffin Bay. Probability of occurrence was consistently higher in this region than other regions within the study area. Predicted occurrence was also high in portions of Corpus Christi, Aransas, San Antonio Bays, and the southern portion of Galveston Bay. Overall, probability of occurrence increased with increasing distance from tidal inlets. The development of spatially explicit models allows for prioritization and conservation of areas in a region that has great potential for human disturbance and climate change impacts. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {Ecological models can act as interesting tools to support decision-making in river restoration management. In particular models which are capable of predicting the habitat requirements of species are of considerable importance to ensure that the planned actions have the desired effects on the aquatic ecosystem. To this end, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were tested and optimized for the prediction of the habitat suitability for Gammarus pulex, a relevant indicator species in water quality assessment. Although ANN models are in general quite robust with a rather high predictive reliability, the model performance had to be increased with regard to simulations for river restoration management. In particular, it has been shown that spatial and temporal expert-rules could possibly be included. Migration dynamics of downstream drift and upstream migration of the organisms and migration barriers along the river (weirs, culverted river sections,...) might indeed deliver important additional information on the effectiveness of the restoration plans, and also on the timing of the expected effects. In this context, an additional in-stream migration model for Gammarus pulex was developed. This migration model, implemented in a Geographical Information System (GIS), has been used to simulate a practical river restoration scenario for a river in Flanders, Belgium. The case study illustrated that the removal of a weir, at a particular site, resulted in the improvement of the habitat suitability for Gammarus pulex. The ANN models predicted that after restoration the habitat was suitable again for Gammarus pulex. The migration model indicated that the restored parts of the river would be recolonized within about 2 months. In this way, decision makers can have an idea whether and when a restoration option will have a desired effect.},

Several unanswered questions about the distribution of the eel and their larvae downstream of the NEC, however, remain and are unlikely to be resolved by observations alone. Three such questions are about (1) previous misdetermination of spawning ground, (2) the large larval catch off the west coast of Taiwan, not off the east coast, and (3) the low abundance of larvae in Korean coastal waters. It had been thought that the physiological behavior of adult and larval eels and their adaptation to different environments determined their distributions. However, we have demonstrated that these issues can be explained by the water circulation in the North Pacific.},

In this review we suggest criteria for defining storage in ecological and eonomic contexts in order to examine the costs and benefits of storage. We then evaluate the evidence for, and ecological importance of, different types of storage.

abstract = {In this paper we describe how a distributed real-time underwater video observational system, developed and operated in southern Taiwan, can be used for visual environmental monitoring of a coral reef ecosystem. The method makes use of an innovative fish recognition and identification technique for real-world automatic underwater observation. Our research demonstrated that advanced fish recognition and identification techniques can be used to study fish populations and to identify species of fish that appear for the first time in particular areas of interest. The observational system subsequently accumulates massive tera-scale video data that can be used for long-term studies on coral reef fish. The system has the capacity for efficient and accurate recognition of fishes from the video dataset, which is recorded in a setting of biological abundance in a coral reef ecosystem. A simple and effective preprocess for fish detection from the video data has been developed, in which multiple bounding-surrounding boxes are introduced to discriminate between swimming fish and other moving objects, such as moving sea anemones and drifting water plants. Additional data, including images of various features from a number of fish species, taken at various angles and illumination conditions, can form the basis for a fish-category database. A maximum probability, partial ranking method, based on sparse representation-based classification (SRC-MP), is proposed for real-world fish recognition and identification. Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces are used to extract feature data, by means of the fish-category database. Two parameters - feature space dimension and partial ranking value - are used to optimize the solutions, in which the recognition and identification rates can respectively achieve 81.8{\%} and 96{\%}. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is robust and highly accurate for the use of fish recognition and identification of real-world underwater observational video data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Multivariate analysis (DCCA), performed on species biomass (tnm-2), indicated a spatial structuring of the estuarine community in three areas: inner, central and outer. Bottom salinity was the main factor associated with the significant differences in species composition. Examination of the estuary as a whole indicated a persistent spatial pattern, and suggested that temperature has the strongest influence on seasonal structure of fish assemblages. Both seasonal migrations (for example, of Trichiurus lepturus and Discopyge tschudii) and reproductive movements (for example, of Micropogonias furnieri, Mustelus schmitti and Cynoscion guatucupa), appear as important factors affecting the temporal structure of the estuarine community. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We established a series of 9 1-ha plots in old-growth tropical rainforest in Costa Rica along a 2700 m relief elevational gradient to carry out long-term monitoring of tropical rain forest structure, dynamics and tree growth. Within each plot we mapped, identified, and annually measured diameter for all woody individuals with stem diameters {\textgreater}10 cm for periods of 3-10 years. Wood species diversity peaked at 400-600 m and decreased substantially at higher elevations. Basal area and stem number varied by less than two-fold, with the exception of the 2800 m cloud forest summit, where basal area and stem number were approximately double that of lower sites. Canopy gaps extending to the forest floor accounted for {\textless}3{\%} of microsites at all elevations. Height of highest crowns and the coefficient of variation of crown height both decreased with increasing elevation. Rates of turnover of individuals and of stand basal area decreased with elevation, but rates of diameter growth and stand basal area showed no simple relation to elevation. We discuss issues encountered in the design and implementation of this network of plots, including biased sampling, missing key meteorological and biomass data, and strategies for improving species-level research. Taking full advantage of the major research potential of tropical forest elevational transects will require sustaining and extending ground based studies, incorporation of new remotely-sensed data and data-acquisition platforms, and new funding models to support decadal research on these rapidly-changing systems.},

abstract = {Baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) are used for monitoring fish assemblages and assessing management effectiveness in reef environments but are infrequently used in estuaries. A review of the BRUVS literature found that most adopted sampling designs from other studies were rarely designed from pilot studies. This potentially compromises their value for monitoring natural and anthropogenic variation. The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the suitability of BRUVS for sampling fishes in estuarine habitats (seagrass beds and unvegetated sediments) and (ii) to develop an optimal and cost effective sampling methodology for each habitat. Fishes in both habitats were sampled independently using BRUVS with soak times of 30, 60, 90. min (n=4). Thirty five species of fishes were recorded including 18 species of economic importance. Mean number of species, mean total Max N and mean Max N of species did not differ among soak times. Precision was generally greater in seagrass and in both habitats it improved with increasing soak time. Bootstrapping revealed that greater improvements in precision occurred from increasing soak time rather than increasing replication. A sampling design with n=5 replicates of 90. min soak time was optimal for most variables. This sampling effort is greater than many current applications of BRUVS. The results highlight the importance of pilot studies to optimise sampling methods and develop cost effective and statistically-robust monitoring programs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract Migration is an important component of the life history and ontogeny of reef fish. On the west coast of Florida, the interaction between ontogenetically migrating reef fish and fishing effort is an important contributor to the pattern of fishing mortality. A biased random walk model was developed to represent the movement of red grouper Epinephelus morio from the inshore nursery habitat occupied by juveniles to the offshore reef habitat inhabited by adults on the West Florida Shelf. A simulated tagging study was conducted to develop distributions of movement speed. Time at large, release location, and input movement speed from conventional tagging data were used to parameterize the simulation. Maturity at age, determined when fish began moving, and directional movement behavior were modeled as functions of preferential habitat. The results suggest that the general movement of tagged fish can be represented using simple assumptions. Comparison of the tagging study and the tagging simulation showed no statistical differences between these two in terms of movement speed, distance traveled, mean size of fish at release, and mean size of fish at recapture. Furthermore, the age distribution of the fish arriving at the reef in the model matched the observed age distribution in the commercial catch. Received February 7, 2011; accepted May 16, 2012},

To better understand global-scale patterns of N cycling, we compiled data on foliar N isotope ratios (delta(15)N), foliar N concentrations, mycorrhizal type and climate for over 11,000 plants worldwide. Arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal, and ericoid mycorrhizal plants were depleted in foliar delta(15)N by 2 per thousand, 3.2 per thousand, 5.9 per thousand, respectively, relative to nonmycorrhizal plants. Foliar delta(15)N increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation and with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) across sites with MAT {\textgreater}or= -0.5 degrees C, but was invariant with MAT across sites with MAT {\textless} -0.5 degrees C. In independent landscape-level to regional-level studies, foliar delta(15)N increased with increasing N availability; at the global scale, foliar delta(15)N increased with increasing foliar N concentrations and decreasing foliar phosphorus (P) concentrations. Together, these results suggest that warm, dry ecosystems have the highest N availability, while plants with high N concentrations, on average, occupy sites with higher N availability than plants with low N concentrations. Global-scale comparisons of other components of the N cycle are still required for better mechanistic understanding of the determinants of variation in foliar delta(15)N and ultimately global patterns in N cycling.},

This article attempts to quantify global phosphorus fluxes associated with present mining, farming, animal feeding, and household consumption. Varieties of physical characteristics of the related phosphorus fluxes as well as their environmental impacts in different economies, especially in the United States, European countries, and China, are taken into consideration. Particular attention is given to the global phosphorus budget in cropland and the movement and transformation of phosphorus in soil, because these phosphorus flows in relation with the farming sector constitute major fluxes that dominate the anthropogenic phosphorus cycle. The results show that the global input of phosphorus to cropland, in both inorganic and organic forms from various sources, cannot compensate the removal in harvests and the losses of erosion and runoff.},

Yellow-phase eels displaced down the estuary moved mainly during flooding tides both day and night. Non-displaced eels used selective tidal stream transport to make long, round trip excursions and to move about their home range. Eels were at or near the surface during most of their movements, but were also vertically active, diving transiently to mid-water or to the bottom. During movements, the eels tended to drift with the current, or to swim slowly in the direction of the current. Although they used the tidal currents effectively as a transport mechanism, they were not precise in timing their movements to maximize transport on each tide. This study demonstrates that both yellow-and silver-phase eels use selective tidal stream transport during movements in tidal habitats and excludes some cues previously proposed to regulate the behaviour.},

abstract = {We report on the development and validation of a coupled two- and one-dimensional finite-element model for the Scheldt tributaries, river, estuary and region of fresh water influence (ROFI). The hydrodynamic equations are solved on a single, unstructured, multi-scale mesh stretching from the shelf break to the Scheldt tributaries. The tide is forced on the shelf break and propagates upstream in the riverine network. Upstream boundaries lie on sluices or outside of the region of tidal dominance where daily averaged discharges are imposed. Two-dimensional, depth-averaged shallow water equations are solved by means of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method over the marine and estuarine parts of the computational domain. In the rivers, however, one-dimensional equations are dealt with using the DG method with the addition of a technique to cope with confluence points. Model parameters are carefully calibrated, leading to the simulation of wind- and tide-forced flows that are in excellent agreement with available data. The diffusivity in the transport equation is calibrated using time series of salinity at various locations in the estuary. Finally, the Lagrangian residual transport in the estuary and the adjacent coastal zone is investigated. This work is a major step towards an integrated model for studying the dynamics of waterborne contaminants and the water renewal timescales in the Scheldt land-sea continuum. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Downstream migration fluxes were monitored using eel traps and related to environmental factors. Intensive electrofishing and fyke-net fishing were conducted to assess eel biomass, densities, and population structure. A total of 564 eels, including 81 silver eels, were PIT tagged. In 1996, 616 eels were caught in the catchment including 68 silver eels (11{\%}). During the following downstream migration period, 12 of the PIT-tagged silver eels, among a total of 678, were recaptured in the down- stream traps. Seven were recaptured in the catchment in 1997. It was shown that (i) only about 20{\%} of the silver eels present in the catchment emigrated during the following year, (ii) 12{\%} stayed in the catchment including two (3.4{\%}) that recovered yellow eel characteristics, and (iii) the other eels either died or settled in the catchment but were not re- captured.

At 2400 and 3000m, foliar concentrations of N, P, S and Kwere similar to nutrient concentrations in tropical trees with apparent nutrient deficiency, as presented in literature. Unlike foliar nutrient concentrations, the amounts of plant-available nutrients in mineral soil were not affected by altitude or increased significantlywith increasing altitude. High C:N ratios (25:1 at 2400mand 34:1 at 3000m) and C:P ratios (605:1 at 2400m and 620:1 at 3000m) in the soil organic layer suggested slow mineralization of plant litter and thus, a low availability ofNand P at high altitudes. FoliarN:P ratios were significantly higher at 2400m(11.3:1) than at 3000m (8.3:1), indicating that at high altitudes,N supplywas more critical than P supply. In conclusion, the access of plants to several nutrients, most likely N, P, S and K, decreased markedly with increasing altitude in this tropical montane forest.},

abstract = {There are pressing reasons for developing a better understanding of net primary production (NPP) in the world's forests. These ecosystems play a large role in the world's carbon budget, and their dynamics, which are likely to be responding to global changes in climate and atmospheric composition, have major economic implications and impacts on global biodiversity. Although there is a long history of forest NPP studies in the ecological literature, current understanding of ecosystem-level production remains lim- ited. Forest NPP cannot be directly measured; it must be approached by indirect methods. To date, field measurements have been largely restricted to a few aspects of NPP; methods are still lacking for field assessment of others, and past studies have involved confusion about the types of measurements needed. As a result, existing field-based estimates of forest NPP are likely to be significant underestimates. In this paper we provide a conceptual framework to guide efforts toward improved estimates of forest NPP. We define the quantity NPP* as the summed classes of organic material that should be measured or estimated in field studies for an estimate of total NPP. We discuss the above- and belowground components of NPP* and the available methods for measuring them in the field. We then assess the implications of the limitations of past studies for current understanding of NPP in forest ecosystems, discuss how field NPP* measurements can be used to complement tower-based studies of forest carbon flux, and recommend design criteria for future field studies of forest NPP.},

We reviewed the literature on temporal changes in coral reef fish assemblages derived from underwater visual census (UVC) and found that movement was rarely considered in experimental design and analysis or as cause of change in interpretation of the results. Studies of vagile species, large individuals, species forming transient spawning aggregations and studies of fishes in contiguous habitats are most likely to be affected by such movements. Ignoring predictable patterns of movement associated with such natural cycles in survey design and analysis increases "unexplained" variation, making it more difficult to detect longer-term changes in fish assemblages and reducing the effectiveness of UVC as a monitoring tool.},

abstract = {Continuous surface of river bathymetry (bed topography) is typically produced by spatial interpolation of discrete point or cross-section data. Several interpolation methods that do not account for spatial trend in river bathymetry produce inaccurate surfaces, thus requiring complex interpolation methods such as anisotropic kriging. Although isotropic methods are unsuitable for interpolating river bathymetry, issues that limit their use remain unaddressed. This paper addresses the issue of effect of spatial trend in river bathymetry on isotropic interpolation methods. It is hypothesized that if the trend is removed from the data before interpolation, the results from isotropic methods should be comparable with anisotropic methods. Data from six river reaches in the United States are used to: (i) interpolate bathymetry data using seven spatial interpolation methods; (ii) separate trend from bathymetry; (iii) interpolate residuals (bathymetry minus trend) by using all seven interpolation methods to get residual surfaces, (iv) add the trend back to residual surfaces; and (v) compare resulting surfaces from (iv) with surfaces created in (i). Quantitative and qualitative comparison of results through root mean square error (RMSE), semi-variograms, and cross-section profiles show that significant improvement (as much as 60{\%} in RMSE) can be accomplished in spatial interpolation of river bathymetry by separating trend from the data. Although this paper provides a new simple way for interpolating river bathymetry by using (otherwise deemed inappropriate) isotropic methods, the choice of trend function and spatial arrangement of discrete bathymetry data play a vital role in successful implementation of the proposed approach. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Aim: An understanding of the relationship between forest biomass and climate is needed to predict the impacts of climate change on carbon stores. Biomass patterns have been characterized at geographically or climatically restricted scales, making it unclear if biomass is limited by climate in any general way at continental to global scales. Using a dataset spanning multiple climatic regions we evaluate the generality of published biomass-climate correlations. We also combine metabolic theory and hydraulic limits to plant growth to first derive and then test predictions for how forest biomass should vary with maximum individual tree biomass and the ecosystem water deficit. Location: Temperate forests and dry, moist and wet tropical forests across North, Central and South America. Methods: A forest biomass model was derived from allometric functions and power-law size distributions. Biomass and climate were correlated using extensive forest plot (276 0.1-ha plots), wood density and climate datasets. Climate variables included mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, their ratio, precipitation of the driest quarter, potential and actual evapotranspiration, and the ecosystem water deficit. The water deficit uniquely summarizes water balance by integrating water inputs from precipitation with water losses due to solar energy. Results: Climate generally explained little variation in forest biomass, and mixed support was found for published biomass-climate relationships. Our theory indicated that maximum individual biomass governs forest biomass and is constrained by water deficit. Indeed, forest biomass was tightly coupled to maximum individual biomass and the upper bound of maximum individual biomass declined steeply with water deficit. Water deficit similarly constrained the upper bound of forest biomass, with most forests below the constraint. Main conclusions: The results suggest that: (1) biomass-climate models developed at restricted geographic/climatic scales may not hold at broader scales; (2) maximum individual biomass is strongly related to forest biomass, suggesting that process-based models should focus on maximum individual biomass; (3) the ecosystem water deficit constrains biomass, but realized biomass often falls below the constraint; such that (4) biomass is not strongly limited by climate in most forests so that forest biomass may not predictably respond to changes in mean climate.},

Here we test the applicability of remote sensing, particularly novel use of waveform lidar measurements, for quantifying the habitat heterogeneity of a contiguous northern hardwoods forest in the northeastern United States. We apply these results to predict the breeding habitat quality, an indicator of reproductive output of a well-studied Neotropical migrant songbird, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens). We found that using canopy vertical structure metrics provided unique information for models of habitat quality and spatial patterns of prevalence. An ensemble decision tree modeling approach (random forests) consistently identified lidar metrics describing the vertical distribution and complexity of canopy elements as important predictors of habitat use over multiple years. Although other aspects of habitat were important, including the seasonality of vegetation cover, the canopy structure variables provided unique and complementary information that systematically improved model predictions. We conclude that canopy structure metrics derived from waveform lidar, which will be available on future satellite missions, can advance multiple aspects of biodiversity research, and additional studies should be extended to other organisms and regions.},

Current sensors onboard airborne and spaceborne platforms cover large areas of the Earth surface with unprecedented spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. These characteristics enable a myriad of applications requiring fine identification of materials or estimation of physical parameters. Very often, these applications rely on sophisticated and complex data analysis methods. The sources of difficulties are, namely, the high dimensionality and size of the hyperspectral data, the spectral mixing (linear and nonlinear), and the degradation mechanisms associated to the measurement process such as noise and atmospheric effects. This paper presents a tutorial/overview cross section of some relevant hyperspectral data analysis methods and algorithms, organized in six main topics: data fusion, unmixing, classification, target detection, physical parameter retrieval, and fast computing. In all topics, we describe the state-of-the-art, provide illustrative examples, and point to future challenges and research directions.},

abstract = {Site-specific height-diameter models may be used to improve biomass estimates for forest inventories where only diameter at breast height (DBH) measurements are available. In this study, we fit height-diameter models for vegetation types of a tropical Atlantic forest using field measurements of height across plots along an altitudinal gradient. To fit height-diameter models, we sampled trees by DBH class and measured tree height within 13 one-hectare permanent plots established at four altitude classes. To select the best model we tested the performance of 11 height-diameter models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Weibull and Chapman- Richards height-diameter models performed better than other models, and regional site-specific models performed better than the general model. In addition, there is a slight variation of height- diameter relationships across the altitudinal gradient and an extensive difference in the stature between the Atlantic and Amazon forests. The results showed the effect of altitude on tree height estimates and emphasize the need for altitude-specific models that produce more accurate results than a general model that encompasses all altitudes. To improve biomass estimation, the development of regional height-diameter models that estimate tree height using a subset of randomly sampled trees presents an approach to supplement surveys where only diameter has been measured.

abstract = {This paper reports a statistical analysis of the causes of agricultural colonization and land clearing in eastern Ecuador. The results bolster many of the arguments that have been made about the social forces driving tropical deforestation. In general, the prospect of capturing agricultural rents stimulates settlement of tree-covered hinterlands. Accordingly, the presence of roads and urban centers attracts rural settlement. Colonists also prefer to go where soils are suitable for crop or livestock production, all else remaining the same. In addition to being a function of population pressure, the extent of land clearing is shown to be a consequence of tenure insecurity. These results suggest that institutional reform is needed to encourage conservation of tropical forests. ?? 1991.},

Model results, which agree well with observations, show a seasonal cycle in the transport of the EUC, reaching a maximum during the late spring/early summer and minimum in the late fall.

Telemetry array coverage areas ranged between 100 and 300. m across. For fixed transmitters within the array, the fraction of transmissions leading to high-quality calculated position estimates averaged 44{\%}, with wide variation. Positional accuracy was about 2. m. The choice of filtering strictness represented a trade-off between the accuracy and frequency of positions. There was substantial temporal variation, but no clear pattern (e.g., daily or tidal correlations) in frequency of positions. There was no spatial bias within the array. Array performance for stationary transmitters was robust to user errors in sound speed and hydrophone position estimates. Performance was less robust for a transmitter attached to an autonomous underwater vehicle moving through the array, with 22{\%} of transmissions leading to position estimates. Overall the system produced reliable results, but as the use of acoustic telemetry in complex ecological studies increases it is important to recognize technological requirements and limitations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the methods for quantifying resistance surfaces are varied and there is no general consensus on the appropriate choice of environmental data or analytical approaches. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic to highlight methods used and identify knowledge gaps. Our review includes 96 papers that parameterized resistance surfaces (sometimes using multiple approaches) for a variety of taxa. Data types used included expert opinion (n = 76), detection (n = 23), relocation (n = 8), pathway (n = 2), and genetic (n = 28). We organized the papers into three main analytical approaches; one-stage expert opinion, one-stage empirical, and two-stage empirical, each of which was represented by 43, 22, and 36 papers, respectively. We further organized the empir- ical approaches into five main resource selection functions; point (n = 16), matrix (n = 38), home range (n = 3), step (n = 1), and pathway (n = 1).We found a general lack of justification for choice of environmental variables and their thematic and spatial representation, a heavy reliance on expert opinion and detection data, and a tendency to confound movement behavior and resource use. Future research needs include comparative analyses on the choice of envi- ronmental variables and their spatial and thematic scales, and on the various biological data types used to estimate resistance. Comparative analyses amongst analytical processes is also needed, as well as trans- parency in reporting on uncertainty in parameter estimates and sensitivity of final resistance surfaces, especially if the resistance surfaces are to be used for conservation and planning purposes},

Calcium return is also high in most tropical forests studied, but many tropical forests (lowland and montane) have little phosphorus return and very high dry mass/phosphorus ratios in litterfall compared to most temperate forests. Phosphorus appears to be cycled highly efficiently in such forests.

From concomitant measurements of the air-water CO2 gradient, we computed the gas transfer velocity of CO2. The gas transfer velocity is well correlated to wind speed and a simple linear regression function gives the most consistent fit to the data. Based on water current measurements, we estimated the contribution of water current induced turbulence to the gas transfer velocity, using the conceptual relationship of O'Connor and Dobbins (1958). This allowed us to construct an empirical relationship to compute the gas transfer velocity of CO2 that accounts for the contribution of wind and water current. Based on this relationship, the spatial and temporal variability of the gas transfer velocity in the Scheldt estuary was investigated. Water currents contribute significantly to the gas transfer velocity, but the spatial and temporal variability (from daily to seasonal scales) is mainly related to wind speed variability.

abstract = {In experiments with plants grown in pots, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae increased seedling growth of 23 of 28 species from a lowland tropical rain forest region. Mycorrhizae improved survival in six species and cotyledon retention in five species. Mycorrhizae also increased the size of bacterial nodules and the proportion of modulated plants among three leguminous species. Growth of seedlings lacking mycorrhizae slowed greatly or ceased after attainment of sizes cor- related with average seed dry mass. Removing cotyledons from individuals of two species that are dependent on mycorrhizae, however, did not increase their response to inoculation. Thus, seed reserves are important for mycorrhiza formation as well as for seedling growth before infection. Large seeds are advantageous to plants that depend on vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae because they provide mineral reserves upon which the seedling can draw while awaiting infection. Seedlings of some species could not grow without mycorrhizae, but inoculation did not affect the growth of other species. Species that are least dependent on mycorrhizae have light seeds and colonize disturbed habitats},

abstract = {Aim  Two core assumptions of species distribution models (SDMs) do not hold when modelling invasive species. Invasives are not in equilibrium with their environment and niche quantification and transferability in space and time are limited. Here, we test whether combining global- and regional-scale data in a novel framework can overcome these limitations. Beyond simply improving regional niche modelling of non-native species, the framework also makes use of the violation of regional equilibrium assumptions, and aims at estimating the stage of invasion, range filling and risk of spread in the near future for 27 invasive species in the French Alps. Innovation  For each invader we built three sets of SDMs using a committee averaging method: one global model and two regional models (a conventional model and one using the global model output to weight pseudo-absences). Model performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the true skill statistic, sensitivity and specificity scores. Then, we extracted the predictions for observed presences and compared them to global and regional models. This comparison made it possible to identify whether invasive species were observed within or outside of their regional and global niches. Main conclusions  This study provides a novel methodological framework for improving the regional modelling of invasive species, where the use of a global model output to weight pseudo-absences in a regional model significantly improved the predictive performance of regional SDMs. Additionally, the comparison of the global and regional model outputs revealed distinct patterns of niche estimates and range filling among the species. These differences allowed us to draw conclusions about the stage of invasion and the risk of spread in the near future, which both correspond to experts' expectations. This framework can be easily applied to a large number of species and is therefore useful for control of biological invasions and eradication planning.},

abstract = {A heuristic framework for understanding and predicting the distribution and categorical abundance of species in stream communities is presented. The framework requires that species be described in terms of their functional relationships to habitat selective forces or their surrogates, which constitute "filters" occurring at hierarchical landscape scales (ranging from microhabitats to water- sheds or basins). Large-scale filters are viewed as causative or mechanistic agents that constrain expression of local selective forces or biotic potential at lower scales. To join a local com...'Tiunity, species in a regional pool must possess appropriate functional attributes (species traits) to "pass" through the nested filters. Biotic interactions are also a potential filter on local community composition, and they are invoked at the lower hierarchical levels, after species have passed through the physico- chemical habitat filters. Potential landscape filters and their associated selective properties are iden- tified, as are prospective species traits (for invertebrates and fish) that correspond with filters. A categorical niche model is used to illustrate how relative abundances of species in local communities might be predicted from habitat data collected at different scales. The framework emphasizes a biologically based approach to understanding and predicting species distribution and abundance and local community composition by explicitly considering environmen- tal constraints imposed at different scales. As such, it can complement non-mechanistic, correlative approaches to community prediction that often lack generality. Operationalizing the framework will require additional research to specify more clearly 1) the degree to which habitat features at different scales are linked functionally or statistically, 2) what species traits are possessed by strongly inter- active species (e.g., keystones) and which habitat filters most strongly constrain the distribution of these species, and 3) the functional significance of a range of species traits and the extent to which these traits are correlated and hence respond in concert to the presence, or modification, of a particular filter. Multi-scale, mechanistic understanding of specie!H?nvironment relations will likely contribute to better predictions about large scale problems, such as the establishment and spread of exotic species or alterations in community composition with changing land use or climate.

Location The global planetary ecosystem. Methods The 4-year average annual NPP/GPP ratio of the Earth's land area was calculated using 2000–03 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The global pattern of the NPP/GPP ratio was investigated by comparing it among each typical terrestrial ecosystem and plotting it along a geographical and climatic gradient, including latitude, altitude, temperature and precipitation. Results The global terrestrial ecosystem had an average NPP/GPP ratio value of 0.52 with minor variation from 2000 to 2003. However, the NPP/GPP ratio showed considerable spatial variation associated with ecosystem type, geographical location and climate. Densely vegetated ecosystems had a lower NPP/GPP ratio than sparsely vegetated ecosystems. Forest ecosystems had a lower NPP/GPP ratio than shrub and herbaceous ecosystems. Geographically, the NPP/GPP ratio increased with altitude. In the Southern Hemisphere, the NPP/GPP ratio decreased along latitude from 30 ° to 10 ° and it exhibited high fluctuation in the Northern Hemisphere. Climati- cally, the NPP/GPP ratio exhibited a decreasing trend along enhanced precipitation when it was less than 2300 mm year –1 *, Hua Chen 3 and Jonathan Adams 4 and a static trend when the annual precipitation was over 2300 mm. The NPP/GPP ratio showed a decreasing trend along temperature when it was between –20 ° C and 10 ° C, and showed an increasing trend along rising temperature when it was between –10 ° C and 20 ° C. Within each ecosystem, the NPP/GPP ratio revealed a similar trend to the global trend along temperature and precipitation. Conclusions The NPP/GPP ratio exhibited a pattern depending on the main climatic characteristics such as temperature and precipitation and geographical factors such as latitude and altitude. The findings of this research challenge the widely held assumption that the NPP/GPP ratio is consistent regardless of ecosystem type.},

Eighty-nine percent of the tagged eels were detected. All migrant eels (111) exhibited unidirectional and downstream movements, but the migration was not completed in one continuous direct movement. High individual variability in migratory longitudinal profiles was documented as well as in individual speed with no apparent relation to river discharge or morphological traits. Migration speed increased over the season. Our observations demonstrated that migrating silver American eels are largely nocturnal and demonstrated the use of noctur- nal, ebb tide transport to leave the estuary. With 44 additional eels tagged and released in the maritime estuary, escapement of 180 silver American eels from the Gulf of St. Lawrence system was monitored along a 125 km acoustic line that entirely covered Cabot Strait in 2011.

This study aimed to explore the altitudinal patterns and potential drivers of leaf C∶N∶P stoichiometry. We measured the concentrations of leaf C, N and P in 175 plant species as well as soil nutrient concentrations along an altitudinal transect (500-2300 m) on the northern slope of Changbai Mountain, China to explore the response of leaf C∶N∶P stoichiometry to plant growth form (PGF), climate and soil. Leaf C, N, P and C∶N∶P ratios showed significant altitudinal trends. In general, leaf C and C∶N∶P ratios increased while leaf N and P decreased with elevation. Woody and herbaceous species showed different responses to altitudinal gradients. Trees had the largest variation in leaf C, C∶N and C∶P ratios, while herbs showed the largest variation in leaf N, P and N∶P ratio. PGF, climate and soil jointly regulated leaf stoichiometry, explaining 17.6{\%} to 52.1{\%} of the variation in the six leaf stoichiometric traits. PGF was more important in explaining leaf stoichiometry variation than soil and climate.

abstract = {The high spatial variability of estuaries poses a challenge for characterizing estuarine water quality. This problem was examined by conducting monthly high-resolution transects for several water quality variables (chlorophyll a, suspended particulate matter and salinity) in San Francisco Bay (California, U.S.A.). Using these data, six different ways of choosing station locations along a transect, in order to estimate mean conditions, were compared. In addition, 11 approaches to estimating the variance of the transect mean when stations are equally spaced were compared, and the relationship between variance of the estimated transect mean and number of stations was determined. The results provide guidelines for sampling along the axis of an estuary: (1) choose as many equally-spaced stations as practical; (2) estimate the variance of the mean y by var(y) = (1/(10n 2)) sum(yj yj1) 2, where y1,...,yn are the measurements at the n stations; and (3) attain the desired precision by adjusting the number of stations according to var(y) proportional to 1/n 2. The inverse power of 2 in the last step is a consequence of the underlying spatial correlation structure in San Francisco Bay; more studies of spatial structure at other estuaries are needed to determine the generality of this relationship.},

abstract = {The protection, preservation and restoration of aquatic ecosystems and their functions are of global importance. For European states it became legally binding mainly through the EU-Water Framework Directive (WFD). In order to assess the ecological status of a given water body, aquatic biodiversity data are obtained and compared to a reference water body. The quantified mismatch obtained determines the extent of potential management actions. The current approach to biodiversity assessment is based on morpho-taxonomy. This approach has many drawbacks such as being time consuming, limited in temporal and spatial resolution, and error-prone due to the varying individual taxonomic expertise of the analysts. Novel genomic tools can overcome many of the aforementioned problems and could complement or even replace traditional bioassessment. Yet, a plethora of approaches are independently developed in different institutions, thereby hampering any concerted routine application. The goal of this Action is to nucleate a group of researchers across disciplines with the task to identify gold-standard genomic tools and novel eco-genomic indices for routine application in biodiversity assessments of European fresh- and marine water bodies. Furthermore, DNAqua-Net will provide a platform for training of the next generation of European researchers preparing them for the new technologies. Jointly with water managers, politicians, and other stakeholders, the group will develop a conceptual framework for the standard application of eco-genomic tools as part of legally binding assessments.},

Early work in the field concentrated mostly on the development of methods to model effectively the shape of a species response to environmental gradients (Austin 1987, Austin et al. 1990). The methodology and its framework were summarized in reviews 1015 yr ago (Franklin 1995, Guisan and Zimmermann 2000), and these syntheses are still widely used as reference landmarks in the current distribution modelling literature. However, enormous advancements have occurred over the last decade, with hundreds if not thousands of publications on species distribution model (SDM) methodologies and their application to a broad set of conservation, ecological and evolutionary questions. With this special issue, originating from the third of a set of specialized SDM workshops (2008 Riederalp) entitled The Utility of Species Distribution Models as Tools for Conservation Ecology, we reflect on current trends and the progress achieved over the last decade.},

abstract = {Underwater video techniques are increasingly used in marine ecology studies. Technological progress regarding video cameras, sensors (such as sounders), battery life and information storage make these techniques now accessible to a majority of users. However, diver-based underwater visual censuses, and catch and effort data, remain the most commonly used for observing coastal biodiversity and species. In this paper, we review the underwater video techniques that have been developed since the 1950s to investigate and/or monitor coastal biodiversity. Techniques such as remote underwater video, whether baited or not, diver-operated video and towed video are described, along with corresponding applications in the field. We then analyse the complementary of techniques, first from studies comparing video techniques with other observation techniques, whether video-based or not, and second by documenting their respective cost efficiencies. These findings are discussed with respect to current challenges in monitoring and investigating coastal biodiversity. Video should be more often considered and used, either in addition to or as an alternative to diver-based, fishing and acoustic techniques, as it may be particularly suited for monitoring coastal biodiversity in a variety of areas and on larger scales than hitherto and within an ecosystem-based approach to management and conservation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Drawing on recent research, we propose four steps towards making regional influences a stronger part of research on the richness of local communities: (1) identifying the regional-scale causes of variation in species richness in the systems ecologists study; (2) testing for effects of regional richness on local richness, using improved observational and experimental analyses to overcome earlier problems; (3) simultaneously analysing environmental influences on regional and local species richness as well as the influence of regional richness on local richness and (4) considering the potential reciprocal effects of local processes on regional richness. In conclusion, we suggest some ways that similar approaches could be applied to other aspects of community structure beyond species richness.},

We calibrated and validated the retrieval of 15 canopy foliar chemicals and leaf mass per area (LMA) across a network of 79 1-hectare field plots using a new VSWIR-LiDAR fusion approach designed to accommodate the enormous scale mismatch between field and remote sensing studies. The results indicate that sparse and highly variable field sampling can be integrated with VSWIR-LiDAR data to yield demonstrably accurate estimates of canopy foliar chemical traits. This new airborne approach addresses the inherent limitations and sampling biases associated with field-based studies of forest functional traits, particularly in structurally and floristically complex tropical canopies.},

Currently, variants of the sequential extraction procedure developed by M. J. Hedley and co-workers afford the greatest discrimination among labile and non-labile organic and inorganic P pools. Results of recent studies that used this technique to evaluate P fractions in forest soils indicate the following: (1) in intact, highly weathered forest soils of the humid tropics, Hedley-labile P values are several times larger than extractable P values resulting from mildly acidic extracting solutions which were commonly used in the past 2 decades; (2) pools of Hedley-labile P are several times larger than the annual forest P requirement and P required from the soil annually in both temperate and tropical forests; (3) long-term trends in non-labile P pools during pedogenesis are adequately represented by the Walker and Syers' model of changes in P fractionation during soil development. However, to better represent trends in pools that can supply plant-available P across forest soils of different age and weathering status, the paradigm should be modified; and (4) across a wide range of tropical and temperate forest soils, organic matter content is an important determinant of Hedley-labile P.},

abstract = {Site-specific height-diameter models may be used to improve biomass estimates for forest inventories where only diameter at breast height (DBH) measurements are available. In this study, we fit height-diameter models for vegetation types of a tropical Atlantic forest using field measurements of height across plots along an altitudinal gradient. To fit height-diameter models, we sampled trees by DBH class and measured tree height within 13 one-hectare permanent plots established at four altitude classes. To select the best model we tested the performance of 11 height-diameter models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Weibull and Chapman- Richards height-diameter models performed better than other models, and regional site-specific models performed better than the general model. In addition, there is a slight variation of height- diameter relationships across the altitudinal gradient and an extensive difference in the stature between the Atlantic and Amazon forests. The results showed the effect of altitude on tree height estimates and emphasize the need for altitude-specific models that produce more accurate results than a general model that encompasses all altitudes. To improve biomass estimation, the development of regional height-diameter models that estimate tree height using a subset of randomly sampled trees presents an approach to supplement surveys where only diameter has been measured.

abstract = {Species distribution models have often been developed based on ecological data. To develop reliable data-driven models, however, a sound model training and evaluation procedures are needed. A crucial step in these procedures is the assessment of the model performance, with as key component the applied performance criterion. Therefore, we reviewed seven performance criteria commonly applied in presence-absence modelling (the correctly classified instances, Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, the normalised mutual information statistic, the true skill statistic and the odds ratio) and analysed their application in both the model training and evaluation process. Although estimates of predictive performance have been used widely to assess final model quality, a systematic overview was missing because most analyses of performance criteria have been empirical and only focused on specific aspects of the performance criteria. This paper provides such an overview showing that different performance criteria evaluate a model differently and that this difference may be explained by the dependency of these criteria on the prevalence of the validation set. We showed theoretically that these prevalence effects only occur if the data are inseparable by an n-dimensional hyperplane, n being the number of input variables. Given this inseparability, different performance criteria focus on different aspects of model performance during model training, such as sensitivity, specificity or predictive accuracy. These findings have important consequences for ecological modelling because ecological data are mostly inseparable due to data noise and the complexity of the studied system. Consequently, it should be very clear which aspect of the model performance is evaluated, and models should be evaluated consistently, that is, independent of, or taking into account, species prevalence. The practical implications of these findings are clear. They provide further insight into the evaluation of ecological presence/absence models and attempt to assist modellers in their choice of suitable performance criteria. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of soil microbial communities in coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles has become an area of great interest as we strive to understand how global change will influence ecosystem function. In this endeavor, microbially explicit decomposition models are being adopted because they include microbial stoichiometry- and biomass-mediated mechanisms that may be important in shaping ecosystemresponse to environmental change. Yet there has been a dearth of empirical tests to verify the predictions of these models and hence identify potential improvements.We measured the response of soilmicrobes to multiple rates of carbon and nitrogen amendment in experimental microcosms, and used the respiration and nitrogen mineralization responses to assess a well-established, single-pool, microbial decomposition model. The model generally predicted the empirical trends in carbon and nitrogen fluxes, but failed to predict the empirical trends in microbial biomass. Further examination of this discontinuity indicated that the model successfully predicted carbon and nitrogen cycling because stoichiometry overrodemicrobial biomass as a regulator of cycling rates. Stoichiometric controlmeant that the addition of carbon generally increased respiration and decreased nitrogen mineralization, whereas nitrogen had the opposite effects. Biomass only assumed importance as a control on cycling rates when stoichiometric ratios of resource inputs were a close match to those of the microbial biomass. Our work highlights the need to advance our understanding of the stoichiometric demands of microbial biomass in order to better understand biogeochemical cycles in the face of changing organic- and inorganic-matter inputs to terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {Old-growth forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at rates that vary with climate and nitrogen deposition. The sequestered carbon dioxide is stored in live woody tissues and slowly decomposing organic matter in litter and soil. Old-growth forests therefore serve as a global carbon dioxide sink, but they are not protected by international treaties, because it is generally thought that ageing forests cease to accumulate carbon. Here we report a search of literature and databases for forest carbon-flux estimates. We find that in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, net ecosystem productivity (the net carbon balance of the forest including soils) is usually positive. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forests can continue to accumulate carbon, contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral. Over 30 per cent of the global forest area is unmanaged primary forest, and this area contains the remaining old-growth forests. Half of the primary forests (6 x 10(8) hectares) are located in the boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. On the basis of our analysis, these forests alone sequester about 1.3 +/- 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year. Thus, our findings suggest that 15 per cent of the global forest area, which is currently not considered when offsetting increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, provides at least 10 per cent of the global net ecosystem productivity. Old-growth forests accumulate carbon for centuries and contain large quantities of it. We expect, however, that much of this carbon, even soil carbon, will move back to the atmosphere if these forests are disturbed.},

abstract = {1. Behaviour of migratory silver eels and immature yellow eels, Anguilla rostrata, was studied in a choice-chamber apparatus. 2. Silver eels display a negative rheotaxis in both well water and natural stream water. 3. Silver eels reversed the sign of their response, to a positive rheotaxis, when salt water was introduced into the tank. 4. Rheotaxis and the salinity response are proposed as an effective orientation mechanism in the seaward migration of the silver eel. Responses are anticipatory in nature and are thought to be only part of a sequential arrangement of orientation behaviours. 5. Yellow eels showed no rheotactic response in August, but displayed a negative rheotaxis two months later into the fall. This seasonal difference in rheotactic responses of the yellow eels suggests periodic movement away from a home range in what might constitute a "dry run" for the eventual offshore migration. 6. Yellow and silver eels in heterogenous samples showed similar rheotactic responses in fresh water but were segregated by response in salt water. 7. The non-orientation of the yellow eels in the freshwater-saltwater choice suggests that it is the response to salinity which contains the yellow eel in its feeding habitat and later guides the silver eel away from it. 8. Perception of saltwater by silver eels is olfactory. 9. Locomotor activity of silver eels peaked to coincide with periods of naturally occurring darkness, between sunset and moonrise. The relationship between eel migration and lunar period is discussed in this respect. 10. Exogenous control over locomotor activity is indicated by experiments which induced activity during daylight hours. The presence of an endogenous factor is also suggested. {\textcopyright} 1975 Biologischen Anstalt Helgoland.},

abstract = {1. The responses of species and populations to changes in the environment (e.g., changes in climate and land use) are often complex and difficult to predict.2. We have created the SpatialDemography model (R package: spatialdemography). The model is a spatially explicit, stage-structured, matrix-based metacommunity model, with the potential for modeling species' and populations' potential responses to environmental heterogeneity and change.3. The SpatialDemography model assumes a cellular landscape populated by organisms with four life stages: a mobile dispersing stage, two sessile non-reproductive stages, and a reproductive adult stage. Individuals are assumed to originate at the center of a given cell and disperse according to a specified dispersal kernel (e.g., log-normal). All adult individuals are capable of producing offspring. The model approach and framework are described in the context of a hypothetical example with multiple competing species in a four cell landscape. In this example simulation, both spatial location and species interactions were important for understanding population dynamics.4. SpatialDemography can be applied to questions where an understanding of transient and long-term demographic responses to spatiotemporal changes is desired. It is primarily applicable to metapopulations and metacommunities of organisms with early dispersal and sessile adults (i.e. modular organisms such as plants and some marine organisms). SpatialDemography differs from other population models in that it is spatially explicit, can incorporate biotic interactions, and is implemented in R.This article is protected by copyright.

Este trabajo presenta datos sobre los bosques del sur de Ecuador localizados en la Reserva Biol{\'{o}}gica San Francisco, l{\'{i}}mite norte del Parque Nacional Podocarpus. Se propone la siguiente clasificaci{\'{o}}n junto con notas sobre los factores ed{\'{a}}ficos que contribuyen a su estableci- miento. El Bosque Montano Bajo (1800-2150 m), formando el orden Alzateetalia verticillatae, mues- tra 2-3 estratos arb{\'{o}}reos muy diversos, con {\'{a}}rboles de 20-35 m de altura, y es una cl{\'{i}}max mosaico t{\'{i}}pico. Creciendo sobre Terric Haplosaprists y Aquic Dystrupepts, originado del material de derrum- bes viejos, este tipo de bosque se extiende hasta los 2300 m sobre el nivel del mar en quebradas protegidas de viento. A altitudes de 2100-2650 m (menos de 2750 m) la estructura del bosque y la composici{\'{o}}n flor{\'{i}}stica cambia totalmente. Esta vegetaci{\'{o}}n, el Bosque Montano Alto forma el orden de Purdiaeaetalia nutantis y crece sobre Histic Petraquepts. Representando una vegetaci{\'{o}}n monot{\'{i}}pica con un solo estrato arb{\'{o}}reo de 5-10 m (15 m) de altura, completamente dominado por Purdiaea nutans (Cyrillaceae). El bosque ubicado a mayor altitud en el {\'{a}}rea, densamente enlazado con el p{\'{a}}ramo es el Bosque Nublado Subalpino. Descritos como Clusio ellipticae-Weinmannietum cochensis aparecen m{\'{a}}s como una vegetaci{\'{o}}n arbustiva casi impenetrable, y crecen sobre Humaquic Epiaquents. El l{\'{i}}mite del bosque es causado principalmente por los vientos fuertes de la regi{\'{o}}n. Derrumbes e incendios naturales representan el motor de regeneraci{\'{o}}n de los bosques.

abstract = {Foliar water uptake (FWU) is a common water acquisition mechanism for plants inhabiting temperate fog-affected ecosystems, but the prevalence and consequences of this process for the water and carbon balance of tropical cloud forest species are unknown. We performed a series of experiments under field and glasshouse conditions using a combination of methods (sap flow, fluorescent apoplastic tracers and stable isotopes) to trace fog water movement from foliage to belowground components of Drimys brasiliensis. In addition, we measured leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, leaf water repellency and growth of plants under contrasting soil water availabilities and fog exposure in glasshouse experiments to evaluate FWU effects on the water and carbon balance of D. brasiliensis saplings. Fog water diffused directly through leaf cuticles and contributed up to 42{\%} of total foliar water content. FWU caused reversals in sap flow in stems and roots of up to 26{\%} of daily maximum transpiration. Fog water transported through the xylem reached belowground pools and enhanced leaf water potential, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and growth relative to plants sheltered from fog. Foliar uptake of fog water is an important water acquisition mechanism that can mitigate the deleterious effects of soil water deficits for D. brasiliensis.},

abstract = {This study aims to apply seven data-driven methods (i.e. artificial neural networks [ANNs], classification and regression trees [CARTs], fuzzy habitat suitability models [FHSMs], generalized additive models [GAMs], generalized linear models [GLMs], random forests [RF] and support vector machines [SVMs]) to develop data-driven species distribution models (SDMs) for spawning European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), and to compare the predictive performance and the ecological relevance, quantified by the habitat information retrieved from these SDMs (i.e. variable importance and habitat suitability curves [HSCs]). The results suggest RF to yield the most accurate SDM, followed by SVM, CART, ANN, GAM, FHSM and GLM. However, inconsistencies between different performance measures were observed, indicating that different models may obtain a high score on a particular aspect and perform worse on other aspects. Despite their lower predictive ability, GAM, GLM and FHSM proved to be useful, since HSCs could be obtained and thus these techniques allow testing of ecological relevance and habitat suitability. Water depth and flow velocity appeared to be important variables for spawning grayling. The HSCs clearly indicate higher habitat suitability at a lower water depth, a low to medium flow velocity and a higher percentage of medium-sized gravel, whereas the models disagreed on the habitat suitability for the percentage of small-sized gravel. These findings demonstrate the applicability of data-driven SDMs for both habitat prediction and ecological knowledge extraction that are useful for management of a target species. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this study we report results from satellite-linked conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) loggers that were deployed on wild, free-ranging white whales to study the oceanographic structure of an Arctic fjord, Storfjorden, Svalbard. The whales dove to the bottom of the fjord routinely during the study and occupied areas with up to 90{\%} ice-cover, where performance of conventional ship-based CTD-casts wouldhave been difficult. During the initial period of freezing in the fjord, over a period of approximately 2 weeks, 540 CTD profiles were successfully transmitted. The data indicate that Storfjorden has a substantial inflow of warm North AtlanticWater; this is contrary to conventional wisdom that has suggested that it contains only cold Arctic water. This study confirms that marine-mammal-based CTDs have enormous potential for cost-effective, future oceanographic studies; many different marine mammal species target oceanographic discontinuities for foraging and thus may be good ‘adaptive samplers' that naturally seek areas of high oceanographic interest.},

We$\backslash$n analyzed a 19-year dataset of water quality conditions, nutrient loading, and climatic forcing for three estuarine regions$\backslash$n and also computed monthly rates of net production of dissolved O2 and physical transport of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) using a salt- and water-balance model.$\backslash$n Point-source loading of DIN and DIP to the estuary declined by 40–60{\%} following upgrades to sewage treatment plants and correlated$\backslash$n with parallel decreases in DIN and DIP concentrations throughout the Patuxent. Reduced point-source nutrient loading and concentration$\backslash$n resulted in declines in phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and light-saturated carbon fixation, as well as in bottom-layer O2 consumption for upper regions of the estuary. Despite significant reductions in seaward N transport from the middle to lower$\backslash$n estuary, chl-a, turbidity, and surface-layer net O2 production increased in the lower estuary, especially during summer. This degradation of water quality in the lower estuary$\backslash$n appears to be linked to a trend of increasing net inputs of DIN into the estuary from Chesapeake Bay and to above-average$\backslash$n river flow during the mid-1990s. In addition, increased abundance of Mnemiopsis leidyi significantly reduced copepod abundance during summer from 1990 to 2002, which favored increases in chl-a and allowed a shift in total N partitioning from DIN to particulate organic nitrogen. These analyses illustrate (1) the value$\backslash$n of long-term monitoring data, (2) the need for regional scale nutrient management that includes integrated estuarine systems,$\backslash$n and (3) the potential water quality impacts of altered coastal food webs.},

abstract = {Movement of organisms is one of the key mechanisms shaping biodiversity, e.g. the distribution of genes, individuals and species in space and time. Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of 'movement ecology'. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide 'mobile links' between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through 'equalizing' and 'stabilizing' mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.},

abstract = {Variation in climate and soils results in inter-site differences in the assemblages of tree life history strategies within a community which has important implications for ecosystem structure and dynamics. I investigated interspecific and inter-site variation in wood specific gravity-an easily measured indicator of tree life history strategy-in four Neotropical forests and analyzed its correlates. Mean wood specific gravity (oven-dry weight divided by fresh volume, sometimes also referred to as wood density in the literature) differed significantly among sites, varying inversely with soil fertility and independently of rainfall, seasonality and temperature. Mean wood specific gravity values were much higher at Kilometer 41, Manaus, Brazil, where soils are extremely poor, than at Cocha Cashu, Peru, Barro Colorado Island, Panama, or La Selva, Costa Rica, where soils are better and mortality rates of trees are higher. Within sites, wood specific gravity varied widely among species. On Barro Colorado Island, among-species variation was significantly, albeit weakly, negatively correlated with sapling and tree mortality and relative growth rates. Altogether, the results suggest that the distribution of tree life history strategies in a community varies substantially among sites, with important consequences for community and ecosystem properties such as aboveground carbon stores.},

I showed that approximately 50{\%} of the variation in community composition is explained by both environmental and spatial variables. The majority of the data sets were structured by species-sorting dynamics (SS), followed by a combination of SS and mass-effect dynamics. While neutral processes were the only structuring process in 8{\%} of the collected natural communities, disregarding neutral dispersal processes would result in missing important patterns in 37{\%} of the studied communities.

abstract = {Wood density is a crucial variable in carbon accounting programs of both secondary and old-growth tropical forests. It also is the best single descriptor of wood: it correlates with numerous morphological, mechanical, physiological, and ecological properties. To explore the extent to which wood density could be estimated for rare or poorly censused taxa, and possible sources of variation in this trait, we analyzed regional, taxonomic, and phylogenetic variation in wood density among 2456 tree species from Central and South America. Wood density varied over more than one order of magnitude across species, with an overall mean of 0.645 g/cm(3). Our geographical analysis showed significant decreases in wood density with increasing altitude and significant differences among low-altitude geographical regions: wet forests of Central America and western Amazonia have significantly lower mean wood density than dry forests of Central and South America, eastern and central Amazonian forests, and the Atlantic forests of Brazil; and eastern Amazonian forests have lower wood densities than the dry forests and the Atlantic forest. A nested analysis of variance showed that 74{\%} of the species-level wood density variation was explained at the genus level, 34{\%} at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) family level, and 19{\%} at the APG order level. This indicates that genus-level means give reliable approximations of values of species, except in a few hypervariable genera. We also studied which evolutionary shifts in wood density occurred in the phylogeny of seed plants using a composite phylogenetic tree. Major changes were observed at deep nodes (Eurosid 1), and also in more recent divergences (for instance in the Rhamnoids, Simaroubaceae, and Anacardiaceae). Our unprecedented wood density data set yields consistent guidelines for estimating wood densities when species-level information is lacking and should significantly reduce error in Central and South American carbon accounting programs.},

abstract = {Phosphorus availability is commonly assumed to limit productivity in lowland tropical rainforests, yet there is relatively little information on the chemical forms of soil phosphorus in such ecosystems. We used the Hedley sequential fractionation scheme to assess phosphorus chemistry in five soils supporting tropical rainforest on Barro Colorado Island, Republic of Panama. The soils represented a range of orders (Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Oxisols) formed on contrasting geological substrates and topography, but under uniform climate and vegetation. Total phosphorus in surface horizons ranged between 315 and 1114mgPkg-1, being lowest on a soil derived from marine sediments and highest on soils derived from andesite. The majority of the phosphorus occurred in recalcitrant forms, although between 14{\%} and 39{\%} occurred as organic phosphorus. Readily-available phosphate, as extracted by anion-exchange membranes, occurred in small concentrations (4-13mgPkg-1), although labile phosphorus, defined as phosphate extracted by anion-exchange membrane plus inorganic and organic phosphorus extracted by 0.5M NaHCO3, accounted for between 4.7{\%} and 11.4{\%} of the total soil phosphorus. Our results indicate a strong control of geology and topography on soil phosphorus in tropical rainforests, which may have important implications for understanding the diversity and distribution of plant species in such ecosystems. Further, some of the most common soils on Barro Colorado Island, including those on the 50ha forest dynamics plot, are rich in phosphorus despite their relatively advanced stage of pedogenesis. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo-BRUV) stations and diver operated stereo-video (stereo-DOV) transects are increasingly used to sample both tropical and temperate fish assemblages. Compared to in situ visual census methods, the use of stereo-video reduces inter-observer variability, improves definition of the sample unit area, increases accuracy of fish length estimates and provides a permanent record of the assemblage that can be validated where required or independently reanalysed. Previous studies have suggested that stereo-BRUV collects representative data on both carnivorous and herbivorous species and can be more cost-efficient than diver-based survey methods. This study compares estimates of common fish assemblage metrics obtained with stereo-BRUV stations and stereo-DOV transects across 3 biogeographic regions, and uses a cost-optimization procedure to compare the efficiency of these 2 methods. Stereo-BRUV stations were found to sample greater species richness and obtain greater estimates of relative biomass of generalist carnivores, but no differences occurred in the biomass of herbivores sampled by the 2 techniques. Stereo-BRUV stations generally obtained estimates of assemblage metrics with less variance, resulting in greater power to detect spatial and temporal changes in the fish assemblage metrics. Cost benefit analyses found that stereo-BRUV was generally more time efficient than stereo-DOV transects in terms of smaller standard error around the mean of the various metrics considered. However, across the 3 biogeographic regions sampled there was considerable variation in the magnitude of these differences. Results suggest that stereo-BRUV stations are, in general, a more cost-effective method for monitoring fish assemblages than stereo-DOV transects.},

abstract = {The use of species distribution models (SDM) to map and monitor animal and plant distributions has become increasingly important in the context of awareness of environmental change and its ecological consequences. From their original inception as resource inventory and conservation mapping tools, SDM have evolved along with the increasing variety and availability of statistical methods, digital biological, and environmental data with which they are built in a geographic information system. Beyond predicting species distributions, these models have become an important and widely used decision-making tool for a variety of biogeographical applications, such as studying the effects of climate change, identifying potential protected areas, determining locations potentially susceptible to invasion, and mapping vector-borne disease spread and risk. This article outlines the steps involved in formulating an SDM and focuses on the conceptual and theoretical foundations on which it is based and identifies issues that have merited recent and will merit future research attention.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems in southern Ecuador are strongly affected by interannual climate variations. This holds especially true for the episodic El Ni{\~{n}}o events, which cause above-normal precipitation in the coastal region of Ecuador and below normal values in the eastern provinces of the Amazon basin (Bendix, 1999). For the transitional zone between these two extremes, which consists mainly of the andean slopes and larger interandean basins the effect on interannual climate variability is not well known. The PREDICT project monitors regional climate in the provinces of Loja and Zamora-Chinchipe (4 S/79 W), where a strong gradients of precipitation are observed. Between the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Real and the dry valley of Catamayo, which are only 70km apart, rain totals drop from over 4000 mm to only 300 mm per year. These two extremes represent the both sides of the Andean mountain chain and are completely covered by the study area, which is 120 km in diameter. Methods used are a combination of point measurements (climate stations) and remote sensing devices (weather radar, satellite imagery), which enable a high-resolution real-time observation of rain distribution and underlying processes. By this, ideal conditions are given to monitor a potential shift of the transition zone between below-average and above-average rainfall situated in this region, if another ENSO-anomaly occurs. Furthermore variability of atmospheric nutrient inputs is analysed within the scope of the project, to assess further impacts on this ecosystem.},

abstract = {Understanding what governs patterns of soil delta15N and delta13C is limited by the absence of these data assembled throughout the development of individual ecosystems. These patterns are important because stable isotopes of soil organic N and C are integrative indicators of biogeochemical processing of soil organic matter. We examined delta15N of soil organic matter (delta15NSOM) and delta13CSOM of archived soil samples across four decades from four depths of an aggrading forest in southeastern USA. The site supports an old-field pine forest in which the N cycle is affected by former agricultural fertilization, massive accumulation of soil N by aggrading trees over four decades, and small to insignificant fluxes of N via NH3 volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. We examine isotopic data and the N and C dynamics of this ecosystem to evaluate mechanisms driving isotopic shifts over time. With forest development, delta13CSOM became depth-dependent. This trend resulted from a decline of approximately 2 per thousand in the surficial 15 cm of mineral soil to -26.0 per thousand, due to organic matter inputs from forest vegetation. Deeper layers exhibited relatively little trend in delta13CSOM with time. In contrast, delta15NSOM was most dynamic in deeper layers. During the four decades of forest development, the deepest layer (35-60 cm) reached a maximum delta15N value of 9.1 per thousand, increasing by 7.6 per thousand. The transfer of {\textgreater} 800 kg ha(-1) of soil organic N into aggrading vegetation and the forest floor and the apparent large proportion of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi in these soils suggest that fractionation via microbial transformations must be the major process changing delta15N in these soils. Accretion of isotopically enriched compounds derived from microbial cells (i.e., ECM fungi) likely promote isotopic enrichment of soils over time. The work indicates the rapid rate at which ecosystem development can impart delta15NSOM and delta13CSOM signatures associated with undisturbed soil profiles.},

abstract = {1.Non-native species can be major drivers of biodiversity loss and cause economic damage. Predicting the potential distribution of a non-native species, and understanding the environmental factors that limit this distribution, is useful for informing their potential management. This is often carried out using species distribution models (SDMs) that attempt to classify grid cells as suitable or unsuitable for a species based on a set of environmental covariates. 2.A key assumption of SDMs is that a species is in equilibrium with its environment. Spreading non-native species often violate this assumption due to dispersal limitation. 3.We present a simple method for dealing with this problem: dispersal weighting (DW). This uses the probability that a species can disperse to a grid cell to weight a SDM. We use simulations to compare the ability of DW and unweighted models at parameterising the true species–environment relationship (SER) of a simulated species, and to test their ability at predicting the future distribution of this species. We investigate how varying the degree of spatial autocorrelation in explanatory variables affects the performance of the methods. 4.Dispersal weighting models outperformed unweighted models at parameterising the SER, and at predicting the future distribution of the species when dispersal probabilities were incorporated into the model predictions. Unweighted models had a stronger tendency than DW models to overestimate the magnitude of relationships with spatially autocorrelated explanatory variables, but underestimate the magnitude of relationships with randomly distributed variables. 5.We then applied our method to a real case study, using it to model the distribution of the non-native common waxbill Estrilda astrild in the Iberian Peninsula as a function of climate and land-use variables. The relative performance of DW and unweighted models reflected the results of the simulation. 6.We conclude that DW models perform better than unweighted models at modelling the true SER of non-native species, and recommend using DW whenever enough data exist to create a dispersal model.},

abstract = {Correlations between foliar nutrient concentrations and soil nutrient availability have been found in multiple ecosystems. These relationships have led to the use of foliar nutrients as an index of nutrient status and to the prediction of broadscale patterns in ecosystem processes. More recently, a growing interest in ecological stoichiometry has fueled multiple analyses of foliar nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios within and across ecosystems. These studies have observed that N:P values are generally elevated in tropical forests when compared to higher latitude ecosystems, adding weight to a common belief that tropical forests are generally N rich and P poor. However, while these broad generalizations may have merit, their simplicity masks the enormous environmental heterogeneity that exists within the tropics; such variation includes large ranges in soil fertility and climate, as well as the highest plant species diversity of any biome. Here we present original data on foliar N and P concentrations from 150 mature canopy tree species in Costa Rica and Brazil, and combine those data with a comprehensive new literature synthesis to explore the major sources of variation in foliar N:P values within the tropics. We found no relationship between N:P ratios and either latitude or mean annual precipitation within the tropics alone. There is, however, evidence of seasonal controls; in our Costa Rica sites, foliar N:P values differed by 25{\%} between wet and dry seasons. The N:P ratios do vary with soil P availability and/or soil order, but there is substantial overlap across coarse divisions in soil type, and perhaps the most striking feature of the data set is variation at the species level. Taken as a whole, our results imply that the dominant influence on foliar N:P ratios in the tropics is species variability and that, unlike marine systems and perhaps many other terrestrial biomes, the N:P stoichiometry of tropical forests is not well constrained. Thus any use of N:P ratios in the tropics to infer larger-scale ecosystem processes must comprehensively account for the diversity of any given site and recognize the broad range in nutrient requirements, even at the local scale.},

abstract = {AimIt is increasingly accepted that the mean wood density of trees within a forest is tightly coupled to above-ground forest biomass. It is unknown, however, if a positive relationship between forest biomass and mean community wood density is a general phenomenon across forests. Understanding spatial variation in biomass as a function of wood density both within and among forests is important for predicting changes in stored carbon in response to global change, and here we evaluated the generality of a positive biomass-wood density relationship within and among six tropical forests.LocationCosta Rica, Panama, Puerto Rico and Ecuador.MethodsIndividual stem data, including diameter at breast height and spatial position, for six forest dynamics plots were merged with an extensive wood density database. Individual stem biomass values were calculated from these data using published statistical models. Total above ground biomass, total basal area and mean community wood density were also quantified across a range of subcommunity plot sizes within each forest.ResultsAmong forests, biomass did not vary with mean community wood density. The relationship between subcommunity biomass and mean wood density within a forest varied from negative to null to positive depending on the size of subcommunities and forest identity. The direction of correlation was determined by the associated total basal area-mean wood density correlation, the slope of which increased strongly with whole forest mean wood density.Main conclusionsThere is no general relationship between forest biomass and wood density, and in some forests, stored carbon is highest where wood density is lowest. Our results suggest that declining wood density, due to global change, will result in decreased or increased stored carbon in forests with high or low mean wood density, respectively.},

abstract = {1. Developing the next-generation of species distribution modelling (SDM) requires solutions to a number of widely recognised problems. Here, we address the problem of uncertainty in predictor variables arising from fine-scale environmental variation. 2. We explain how this uncertainty may cause scale-dependent ‘regression dilution', elsewhere a well-understood statistical issue, and explain its consequences for SDM. We then demonstrate a simple, general correction for regression dilution based on Bayesian methods using latent variables. With this correction in place, unbiased estimates of species occupancy vs. the true environment can be retrieved from data on occupancy vs. measured environment, where measured environment is correlated with the true environment, but subject to substantial measurement error. 3. We then show how applying our correction to multiple co-occurring species simultaneously increases the accuracy of parameter estimates for each species, as well as estimates for the true environment at each survey plot – a phenomenon we call ‘neighbourly advice'. With a sufficient number of species, the estimates of the true environment at each plot can become extremely accurate. 4. Our correction for regression dilution could be integrated with models addressing other issues in SDM, e.g. biotic interactions and/or spatial dynamics. We suggest that Bayesian analysis, as employed here to address uncertainty in predictor variables, might offer a flexible toolbox for developing such next-generation species distribution models.},

abstract = {We investigated tree water relations in a lower tropical montane rain forest at 1950-1975 m a.s.l. in southern Ecuador. During two field campaigns, sap flow measurements (Granier-type) were carried out on 16 trees (14 species) differing in size and position within the forest stand. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) and leaf transpiration (E(l)) were measured on five canopy trees and 10 understory plants. Atmospheric coupling of stomatal transpiration was good (decoupling coefficient Omega = 0.25-0.43), but the response of g(s) and E(l) to the atmospheric environment appeared to be weak as a result of the offsetting effects of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) on g(s). In contrast, sap flow (F) followed these atmospheric parameters more precisely. Daily F depended chiefly on PPF sums, whereas on short time scales, VPD impeded transpiration when it exceeded a value of 1-1.2 kPa. This indicates an upper limit to transpiration in the investigated trees, even when soil water supply was not limiting. Mean g(s) was 165 mmol m(-2) s(-1) for the canopy trees and about 90 mmol m(-2) s(-1) for the understory species, but leaf-to-leaf as well as tree-to-tree variation was large. Considering whole-plant water use, variation in the daily course of F was more pronounced among trees differing in size and crown status than among species. Daily F increased sharply with stem diameter and tree height, and ranged between 80 and 120 kg day(-1) for dominant canopy trees, but was typically well below 10 kg day(-1) for intermediate and suppressed trees of the forest interior.},

abstract = {The fate of carbon (C) in organisms, food webs, and ecosystems is to a major extent regulated by mass-balance principles and the availability of other key nutrient el- ements. In relative terms, nutrient limitation implies excess C, yet the fate of this C may be quite different in autotrophs and heterotrophs. For autotrophs nutrient limitation means less fixation of inorganic C or excretion of organic C, while for heterotrophs nutrient limitation means that more of ingested C will ‘‘go to waste'' in the form of egestion or respiration. There is in general a mismatch between autotrophs and decomposers that have flexible but generally high C:element ratios, and consumers that have lower C:element ratios and tighter stoichiometric regulation. Thus, C-use efficiency in food webs may be governed by the element ratios in autotroph biomass and tend to increase when C:element ratios in food approach those of consumers. This tendency has a strong bearing on the sequestration of C in ecosystems, since more C will be diverted to detritus entering soils or sediments when C-use efficiency is low due to stoichiometric imbalance. There will be a strong evolutionary pressure to utilize such excess C for structural and metabolic purposes. This article explores how these basic principles may regulate C sequestration on different scales in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {The process of coral larval dispersal is important for coral reef ecosystems, but remains poorly understood and hard to gauge. Better knowledge of inter-reef connectivity patterns would be useful in enabling better management of coral reef waters however. By employing a spatially explicit numerical modelling approach, we simulate larval dispersal through the central section of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), comprising over 1000 reefs, and identify spatial patterns in the inter-reef connectivity network using a community detection method from network science. This paper presents the modelling approach used and discusses the significance of the results. Inter-reef connectivity networks were estimated for 4 different coral species, and significant differences between them were found. We show how we can partition reefs into clusters, or "communities", that are sparsely connected with each other, and therefore identify important barriers to larval dispersal. By fine-tuning a resolution parameter in the community detection method, we can find dispersal barriers of varying strength. Finally, we show that the average connectivity length scale varies significantly across the different reef communities, and suggest that this may have repercussions for the optimal placement of marine protected areas (MPAs) to maximise connectivity with surrounding reefs. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We found high fungal species richness with OTUs belonging to Glomerales, Diversisporales and Archaeosporales. Despite intensive sampling, the rarefaction curves are still unsaturated for the pristine forest and the reforestation plots. The communities consisted of few frequent and many rare species. No specific interactions are recognizable. The plant individuals are associated with one to ten arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and mostly with one to four. The fungal compositions associated with single plant individuals show a great variability and variety within one plant species. Planted and naturally occurring plants show high similarities in their fungal communities. Pristine forest and reforestation plots showed similar richness, similar diversity and a significantly nested structure of plant-AMF community. The results indicate that small-scale fragmentation presently found in this area has not destroyed the natural AMF community, at least yet. Thus, the regeneration potential of natural forest vegetation at the tested sites is not inhibited by a lack of appropriate mycobionts.},

They enable researchers to document, for long uninterrupted periods, how undisturbed organisms interact with each other and their environment in real time. In spite of advances enabling the monitoring of many physiological and behavioural variables across a range of taxa of various sizes, these devices have yet to be embraced widely by the ecological community. Our review suggests that this technology has immense potential for research in basic and applied animal ecology. Efforts to incorporate biotelemetry into broader ecological research programs should yield novel information that has been challenging to collect historically from free-ranging animals in their natural environments. Examples of research that would benefit from biotelemetry include the assessment of animal responses to different anthropogenic perturbations and the development of life-time energy budgets.},

abstract = {Aim To estimate the concentrations, stoichiometry and storage of soil microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at biome and global scales. Location Global. Method We collected 3422 data points to summarize the concentrations and stoichiometry of C, N and P in soils, soil microbial biomass at global and biome levels, and to estimate the global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N. Results The results show that concentrations of C, N and P in soils and soil microbial biomass vary substantially across biomes; the fractions of soil elements C, N and P in soil microbial biomass are 1.2, 2.6 and 8.0{\%}, respectively. The best estimates of C:N:P stoichiometry for soil elements and soil microbial biomass are 287:17:1 and 42:6:1, respectively, at global scale, and they vary in a wide range among biomes. The vertical distribution of soil microbial biomass follows the distribution of roots up to 1m depth. Main conclusions The global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N were estimated to be 16.7 Pg C and 2.6 Pg N in the 0–30 cm soil profiles, and 23.2 Pg C and 3.7 Pg N in the 0–100 cm soil profiles.We did not estimate P in soil microbial biomass due to insufficient data and insignificant correlation between soil total P and climate variables used for spatial extrapolation. The spatial patterns of soil microbial biomassCandNwere consistentwith those of soil organicCand total N, i.e. high density in northern high latitude, and low density in low latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere.

abstract = {Independence of locational fixes, to reduce the effects of autocorrelation, is often deemed a prereq- uisite for estimation of home range size and utilization when using data derived from telemetric studies. Three methods of estimating times to independence using movement estimates, along with a statistical method of estimating the level of autocorrelation of locational data, were examined for two species of mammal. Attempts to achieve statistically independent data by subsampling resulted in severe redundancy in the data and significant underestimation of range size and rates of move- ment. Even a sample interval of one fix per week did not guarantee independence and also resulted in underestimation of range size despite range asymptotes being reached. It would appear that the correct strategy for the best possible estimation of range size and use from telemetry would be the repeated use of as short a sampling interval as is possible over an extended period of time. Statistical methods to measure levels of autocorrelation in locational data may be useful for comparing rates of range use between different populations of the same species or between species, as long as the same sample interval is used.},

abstract = {As the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. We based our analysis on {\textgreater}2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of SOC. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33{\%}, 42{\%}, and 50{\%} for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was 77{\%} of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56{\%} and 43{\%}, respectively. Globally, the relative distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. The importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29{\%} in cold arid shrublands to 57{\%} in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, intermediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests (P {\textless} 0.05 in all cases). The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in the top 3 m of soil was 2344 Pg C, or 56{\%} more than the 1502 Pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC estimates of 1500-1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and the biomes with the most SOC at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control SOC distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC pools for carbon sequestration strategies.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are responsible for a large proportion of the global terrestrial C flux annually for natural ecosystems. Increased atmospheric CO2 and changes in climate are likely to affect the distribution of C pools in the tropics and the rate of cycling through vegetation and soils. In this paper, I review the literature on the pools and fluxes of carbon in tropical forests, and the relationship of these to nutrient cycling and climate. Tropical moist and humid forests have the highest rates of annual net primary productivity and the greatest carbon flux from soil respiration globally. Tropical dry forests have lower rates of carbon circulation, but may have greater soil organic carbon storage, especially at depths below 1 meter. Data from tropical elevation gradients were used to examine the sensitivity of biogeochemical cycling to incremental changes in temperature and rainfall. These data show significant positive correlations of litterfall N concentrations with temperature and decomposition rates. Increased atmospheric CO2 and changes in climate are expected to alter carbon and nutrient allocation patterns and storage in tropical forest. Modeling and experimental studies suggest that even a small increase in temperature and CO2 concentrations results in more rapid decomposition rates, and a large initial CO2 efflux from moist tropical soils. Soil P limitation or reductions in C:N and C:P ratios of litterfall could eventually limit the size of this flux. Increased frequency of fires in dry forest and hurricanes in moist and humid forests are expected to reduce the ecosystem carbon storage capacity over longer time periods.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {Background: Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) are unique ecosystems with high biodiversity and large carbon reservoirs. To date there have been limited descriptions of the carbon cycle of TMCF. Aims: We present results on the production, allocation and cycling of carbon for two mid-elevation (1500–1750 m) tropical montane cloud forest plots in San Pedro, Kos{\~{n}}ipata Valley, Peru. Methods: We repeatedly recorded the components of net primary productivity (NPP) using biometric measurements, and autotrophic (R a) and heterotrophic (R h) respiration, using gas exchange measurements. From these we estimated gross primary productivity (GPP) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) at the plot level. Results: The plot at 1500 m was found very productive, with our results comparable with the most productive lowland Amazonian forests. The plot at 1750 m had significantly lower productivity, possibly because of greater cloud immersion. Both plots had similar patterns of NPP allocation, a substantial seasonality in NPP components and little seasonality in Ra . Conclusions: These two plots lie within the ecotone between lower and upper montane forests, near the level of the cloud base. Climate change is likely to increase elevation of the cloud base, resulting in shifts in forest functioning. Longer-term surveillance of the carbon cycle at these sites would yield valuable insights into the response of TMCFs to a shifting cloud base.},

abstract = {Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) are usually cultured at high densities to maximize production, but little is known about the physiological and behavioural consequences of high-density fish culture. The purpose of this study was to develop quantitative correlates of activity for fish held under conditions of increasing density, Fifteen hatchery-reared rainbow trout (mean fork length = 432.3 +/- 9.2 mm) were implanted with activity (electromyogram; EMGi) transmitters and randomly assigned to each of three replicate tanks. Original tank densities (15 kg m(-3)) were then increased to 30 and finally to 60 kg m(-3) at weekly intervals by adding additional fish. Remote telemetry signals indicated that activity increased with increasing stocking density. Fish were relatively inactive during the middle of the day, with diel activity patterns not differing among treatments. Fish were more active during periods of darkness, with activity increasing with increasing stocking density. Relationships between swimming speed, EMGi activity and oxygen consumption were developed using a respirometer and used to estimate oxygen consumption of the fish in the density treatments. Average oxygen consumption estimates increased with increasing density treatments as follows: low density = 75.6 mg kg(-1) h(-1): medium density = 90.0 mg kg(-1) h(-1); and high density = 102.6 mg kg(-1) h(-1). Telemetry permits quantification of the effects of increasing density on fish activity. Physiological telemetry devices may provide a useful tool for remotely monitoring animal welfare correlates under controlled conditions for fish exposed to different husbandry conditions and may prove a valuable tool for the aquaculture industry},

abstract = {Accurate numerical simulation of solute transport or multiphase flow through heterogeneous porous media is still a challenge. One reason is that in continuum models, sharp material interfaces are difficult to represent. The finite-element method allows representation of such discontinuities as element-to-element variations of materials; however, result variables are discretized on the finite-element nodes and when a complementary node-centered finite-volume mesh is used to model transport, this discretization smears out potential discontinuities in nodal concentration or saturation. To overcome this dilemma there are two options: either the nodes can be enriched at the interfaces by additional degrees of freedom or the model can be “exploded” along the interfaces. In the latter technique, interface nodes are multiplied so that they match in number the material domains that they join. We develop this latter approach, implementing a transport model that can evolve dependent variable discontinuities at material interfaces. For transport, we developed a new scheme that is higher order accurate in space, even across these discontinuities, and verify that it is consistent with the continuous method. This analysis shows that the new scheme removes a first-order dependence on mesh refinement observed for the continuous method so that coarser meshes can be used for material interfaces.},

abstract = {Elemental stoichiometry constitutes an inherent link between biogeochemistry and the structure and processes within food webs, and thus is at the core of ecosystem functioning. Stoichiometry allows for spanning different levels of biological organization, from cellular metabolism to ecosystem structure and nutrient cycling, and is therefore particularly useful for establishing links between different ecosystem compartments. We review elemental carbon?:?nitrogen?:?phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios in terrestrial ecosystems (from vegetation, leaf litter, woody debris, and dead roots, to soil microbes and organic matter). While the stoichiometry of the plant, litter, and soil compartments of ecosystems is well understood, heterotrophic microbial communities, which dominate the soil food web and drive nutrient cycling, have received increasing interest in recent years. This review highlights the effects of resource stoichiometry on soil microorganisms and decomposition, specifically on the structure and function of heterotrophic microbial communities and suggests several general patterns. First, latitudinal gradients of soil and litter stoichiometry are reflected in microbial community structure and function. Second, resource stoichiometry may cause changes in microbial interactions and community dynamics that lead to feedbacks in nutrient availability. Third, global change alters the C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios of primary producers, with repercussions for microbial decomposer communities and critical ecosystem services such as soil fertility. We argue that ecological stoichiometry provides a framework to analyze and predict such global change effects at various scales.},

abstract = {The allocation of the net primary productivity (NPP) of an ecosystem between canopy, woody tissue and fine roots is an important descriptor of the functioning of that ecosystem, and an important feature to correctly represent in terrestrial ecosystem models. Here, we collate and analyse a global dataset of NPP allocation in tropical forests, and compare this with the representation of NPP allocation in 13 terrestrial ecosystem models. On average, the data suggest an equal partitioning of allocation between all three main components (mean 34 ± 6{\%} canopy, 39 ± 10{\%} wood, 27 ± 11{\%} fine roots), but there is substantial site-to-site variation in allocation to woody tissue versus allocation to fine roots. Allocation to canopy (leaves, flowers and fruit) shows much less variance. The mean allocation of the ecosystem models is close to the mean of the data, but the spread is much greater, with several models reporting allocation partitioning outside of the spread of the data. Where all main components of NPP cannot be measured, litterfall is a good predictor of overall NPP (r(2) = 0.83 for linear fit forced through origin), stem growth is a moderate predictor and fine root production a poor predictor. Across sites the major component of variation of allocation is a shifting allocation between wood and fine roots, with allocation to the canopy being a relatively invariant component of total NPP. This suggests the dominant allocation trade-off is a 'fine root versus wood' trade-off, as opposed to the expected 'root-shoot' trade-off; such a trade-off has recently been posited on theoretical grounds for old-growth forest stands. We conclude by discussing the systematic biases in estimates of allocation introduced by missing NPP components, including herbivory, large leaf litter and root exudates production. These biases have a moderate effect on overall carbon allocation estimates, but are smaller than the observed range in allocation values across sites.},

In this study, we use comparative studies in environmental sciences to assess the performance and to quantify the impacts of data properties on the performance. Two new measures are proposed to compare the performance of the methods applied to variables with different units/scales. A total of 53 comparative studies were assessed and the performance of 72 methods/sub-methods compared is analysed. The impacts of sample density, data variation and sampling design on the estimations of 32 methods are quantified using data derived from their application to 80 variables. Inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), and ordinary co-kriging (OCK) are the most frequently used methods. Data variation is a dominant impact factor and has significant effects on the performance of the methods. As the variation increases, the accuracy of all methods decreases and the magnitude of decrease is method dependent. Irregular-spaced sampling design might improve the accuracy of estimation. The effect of sampling density on the performance of the methods is found not to be significant. The implications of these findings are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

In this light, the present paper explicitly analyses the methodological use of image attributes of air-borne imagery from mangrove forests, and investigates the consistency and constraints of mangrove image attributes in visually interpreted air-borne imagery. Six image attributes are analysed, and their application is illustrated using various mangrove sites in Kenya and Sri Lanka. Comparison of identification keys reveals that minor attributes such as 'ecological position' are informative, and that image attributes for a particular species or genus are apparently less plastic and more widely applicable than formerly assumed. Emphasis on compulsory fieldwork is made and constraints related to reflection and interference, amongst others, are discussed.},

abstract = {The production of aboveground soft tissue represents an important share of total net primary production in tropical rain forests. Here we draw from a large number of published and unpublished datasets (n=81 sites) to assess the determinants of litterfall variation across South American tropical forests. We show that across old-growth tropical rainforests, litterfall averages 8.61±1.91Mg/ha/yr. Secondary forests have a lower annual litterfall than old-growth tropical forests with a mean of 8.01±3.41 Mg/ha/yr. Annual litterfall shows no significant variation with total annual rainfall, either globally or within forest types. It does not vary consistently with soil type, except in the poorest soils (white sand soils), where litterfall is significantly lower than in other soil types (5.42±1.91Mg/ha/yr). Litterfall declines significantly with increasing N:P. We also study the determinants of litterfall seasonality, and find that it does not depend on annual rainfall or on soil type. However, litterfall seasonality is significantly positively correlated with rainfall seasonality. Finally, we assess how much carbon is stored in reproductive organs relative to photosynthetic organs. Mean leaf fall is 5.74±1.83 Mg/ha/yr (71{\%} of total litterfall). Mean allocation into reproductive organs is 0.69±0.40Mg/ha/yr (9{\%} of total litterfall). The investment into reproductive organs divided by leaf litterfall is negatively related to the N:P ratio, suggesting that on poor soils, the allocation to photosynthetic organs is prioritized over that to reproduction. Finally, we discuss the ecological and biogeochemical implications of these results.},

To infer spatial and temporal patterns, species distribution models have been developed for use with many sampling designs and types of data. Recently, it has been shown that count, presence-absence, and presence-only data can be conceptualized as arising from a point process distribution. Therefore, it is important to understand properties of the point process distribution. We examine how the hierarchical species distribution modeling framework has been used to incorporate a wide array of regression and theory-based components while accounting for the data collection process and making use of auxiliary information. The hierarchical modeling framework allows us to demonstrate how several commonly used species distribution models can be derived from the point process distribution, highlight areas of potential overlap between different models, and suggest areas where further research is needed.},

abstract = {The migration route and the spawning site of the European eel Anguilla anguilla are still uncertain. It has been suggested that the Mediterranean eel stock does not contribute to spawning because there is no evidence of eels leaving the Mediterranean Sea. To test this hypothesis, we equipped eight female silver eels from the south of France with pop-up satellite tags during escapement from coastal waters. Once in deeper water, the eels quickly established diel vertical migration (DVM) between the upper and lower mesopelagic zone. Five tagged eels were taken by predators within the Mediterranean, but two eels reached the Atlantic Ocean after six months and at distances greater than 2000 km from release. These eels ceased their DVM while they negotiated the Gibraltar Strait, and remained in deep water until they reached the Atlantic Ocean, when they recommenced DVM. Our results are the first to show that eels from Mediterranean can cross the Strait of Gibraltar and continue their migration into the Atlantic Ocean. This finding suggests that Mediterranean countries, as for other EU states, have an important role to play in contributing to conservation efforts for the recovery of the European eel stock.},

It can be shown by rigorous error analysis that the discontinuous Galerkin method discretization error can be related to the amplitude of the inter-element jumps. Therefore, we use the information contained in jumps to build error metrics and size field. Results are presented for ocean modelling problems.

abstract = {Aim Climate change causes shifts in species distributions, or 'migrations'. Despite the centrality of species distributions to biodiversity conservation, the demonstrated large migration of tropical plant species in response to climate change in the past, and the expected sensitivity of species distributions to modern climate change, no study has tested for modern species migrations in tropical plants. Here we conduct a first test of the hypothesis that increasing temperatures are causing tropical trees to migrate to cooler areas. Location Tropical Andes biodiversity hotspot, south-eastern Peru, South America. Methods We use data from repeated (2003/04-2007/08) censuses of 14 1-ha forest inventory plots spanning an elevational gradient from 950 to 3400 m in Manu National Park in south-eastern Peru, to characterize changes in the elevational distributions of 38 Andean tree genera. We also analyse changes in the genus-level composition of the inventory plots through time. Results We show that most tropical Andean tree genera shifted their mean distributions upslope over the study period and that the mean rate of migration is approximately 2.5-3.5 vertical metres upslope per year. Consistent with upward migrations we also find increasing abundances of tree genera previously distributed at lower elevations in the majority of study plots. Main conclusions These findings are in accord with the a priori hypothesis of upward shifts in species ranges due to elevated temperatures, and are potentially the first documented evidence of present-day climate-driven migrations in a tropical plant community. The observed mean rate of change is less than predicted from the temperature increases for the region, possibly due to the influence of changes in moisture or non-climatic factors such as substrate, species interactions, lags in tree community response and/or dispersal limitations. Whatever the cause(s), continued slower-than-expected migration of tropical Andean trees would indicate a limited ability to respond to increased temperatures, which may lead to increased extinction risks with further climate change.},

abstract = {In the past decade, ecologists have witnessed vast improvements in our ability to collect animal movement data through animal-borne technology, such as through GPS or ARGOS systems. However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics.},

abstract = {Abstract Many factors have been implicated in the decline of Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus in the upper San Francisco Estuary, and the importance of each factor is difficult to determine using field data alone. We describe a spatially explicit, individual-based population model of Delta Smelt configured for the upper estuary. The model followed the reproduction, growth, mortality, and movement of individuals over their entire life cycle on the same spatial grid of cells as the Delta Simulation Model (DSM2) hydrodynamics model. Daily values of water temperature, salinity, and densities of six zooplankton prey types were represented on the spatial grid. Reproduction was evaluated daily, and new individuals were introduced into the model as yolk sac larvae. Growth of feeding individuals was based on bioenergetics and zooplankton densities. Mortality sources included natural mortality, starvation, and entrainment in water diversion facilities. Movement of larvae was determined using a particle tracking model, while movement of juveniles and adults was based on salinity. Simulations were performed for 1995–2005. The baseline simulation was generally consistent with the available data. Predicted daily fractions of larvae entrained and annual fractions of adults entrained were similar in magnitude to data-based estimates but showed less interannual variation. Interannual differences in mean length at age 1 had large effects on maturity and subsequent egg production. Predicted and observed spatial distributions in the fall showed moderately good agreement for extremely low- and high-outflow years. As indicated by the population growth rate, 1998 was the best year and 2001 was the worst year. Water year 1998 (i.e., October 1997–September 1998) was characterized by fast growth in fall 1997, low entrainment, and high stage-specific survival rates, whereas water year 2001 had opposite conditions. Our analysis further shows how multiple factors can operate simultaneously to result in the decline in abundance of Delta Smelt. Received November 9, 2012; accepted April 18, 2013},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomass burning is a source of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen compounds which, along with their photochemically generated reaction products, can be transported over very long distances, even traversing oceans. Chemical analyses of rain and fogwater samples collected in the mountaineous rain forest of south Ecuador show frequent episodes of high sulfate and nitrate concentration, from which annual deposition rates are derived comparable to those found in polluted central Europe. As significant anthropogenic sources are lacking at the research site it is suspected that biomass burning upwind in the Amazon basin is the major source of the enhanced sulfate and nitrate imput. METHODS: Regular rain and fogwater sampling along an altitude profile between 1800 and 3185 m has been carried out in the Podocarpus National Park close to the Rio SanFrancisco (3 degrees 58'S, 79 degrees 5'W) in southern Ecuador. pH values, electrical conductivity and chemical ion composition were measured at the TUM-WZW using standard methods. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results reported cover over one year from March 2002 until May 2003. Annual deposition rates of sulfate were calculated ranging between 4 and 13 kg S/ha year, almost as high as in polluted central Europe. Nitrogen deposition via ammonia (1.5-4.4 kg N/ha year) and nitrate (0.5-0.8 kg N/ha year) was found to be lower but still much higher than to be expected in such pristine natural forest environment. By means of back trajectory analyses it can be shown that most of the enhanced sulfur and nitrogen deposition is most likely due to forest fires far upwind of the ecuadorian sampling site, showing a seasonal variation, with sources predominantly found in the East/North East during January-March (Colombia, Venezuala, Northern Brazil) and East/SouthEast during July-September (Peru, Brazil). CONCLUSION: Our results show that biomass burning in the Amazon basin is the predominant source of sulfur and nitrogen compounds that fertilize the mountaineous rain forest in south Ecuador. RECOMMENDATION AND OUTLOOK: The mountaineous rain forest in south Ecuador has developed on poor and acid soils, with low nutrient availability. The additional ferilization resulting from anthropogenic biomass burning constitutes a significant disturbance of this ecosystem, its functioning and biodiversity. Thus it is planned to employ isotope analyses for quantifying the pathways. of nitrate and sulfate deposition in these natural forests.},

For many organisms, these data take the form of presence or absence at a location, or numbers of individuals at that same location. For species such as trees, where huge size differences exist between individuals, indices such as basal area, metric tons per hectare, or canopy cover are more useful than counts. For any measured species that is handled (or sampled noninvasively; Taberlet et al. 1999; Kendall and McKelvey 2008; Schwartz and Monfort 2008), an additional data source is available: the genetic data stored in the organism's tissue.

abstract = {Geostatistics is a popular class of statistical methods for estimating, or predicting, the value of a continuous spatial process at unobserved locations given the value of the process at a set of known locations. Spatial prediction of this sort is typically performed using the method known as kriging, which provides estimates that are optimized over the class of predictors that are a linear combination of the observed values of the process. Beyond providing point estimates of the process at unobserved locations, the variances of kriging estimates (or kriging standard errors) are readily available as measures of uncertainty in predictions. An underlying assumption in kriging is that the covariance structure of the spatial process is known. Thus, before kriging can be performed, the spatial-dependence structure must be determined using the observed values of the process. Rather than estimating the covariance function of the spatial process directly, an alternative description of the spatial-dependence structure known as the variogram is estimated from the observed data. In this article, we review both kriging and variogram methods. In addition, we illustrate these methods using a rainfall dataset and provide brief introductions to some extensions of standard geostatistical methods.},

abstract = {Aim Tropical forests have been recognized as important global carbon sinks and sources. However, many uncertainties about the spatial distribution of live tree above-ground biomass (AGB) remain, mostly due to limited availability of AGB field data. Recent studies in the Amazon have already shown the importance of large sample size for accurate AGB gradient analysis. Here we use a large stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB dataset to study and explain their spatial patterns in an Asian tropical forest. Location Borneo, Southeast Asia. Methods We combined stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB data from 83 locations in Borneo with an environmental database containing elevation, climate and soil variables. The Akaike information criterion was used to select models and environmental variables that best explained the observed values of stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB. These models were used to extrapolate these parameters across Borneo. Results We found that wood density, stem density, basal area and AGB respond significantly, but differentially, to the environment. AGB was only correlated with basal area, but not with stem density and community wood specific gravity. Main conclusions Unlike results from Amazonian forests, soil fertility was an important positive correlate for AGB in Borneo while community wood density, which is a main driver of AGB in the Neotropics, did not correlate with AGB in Borneo. Also, Borneo's average AGB of 457.1 Mg ha -1 was c. 60{\%} higher than the Amazonian average of 288.6 Mg ha -1 . We find evidence that this difference might be partly explained by the high density of large wind-dispersed Dipterocarpaceae in Borneo, which need to be tall and emergent to disperse their seeds. Our results emphasize the importance of Bornean forests as carbon sinks and sources due to their high carbon storage capacity.},

abstract = {The biogeochemical cycling of N in ecosytems can be divided in an external and internal N cycle. The external cycle includes those processes that add or remove N from ecosystems, like: dinitrogen fixation, denitrification. The internal cycle consists of those processes that convert N from one chemical to another or transfer N between ecosystem pools. Processes of the internal cycle, include: N mineralization, microbial immobilization of N by uptake of bacteria, and nitrification. Most estimates of N mineralization and nitrification have been obtained by measuring net rates that result from two or more processes ocurring simultaneously. Net N mineralization = gross N mineralization - microbial immobilization of NO3-. Measurement of gross nitrogen-transformation rates with three 15N-techniques. The rates of nitrogen transformation under field conditions are then described. Also laboratory methods for estimating Net nitrogen transformation rates are available. Aerobic laboratory incubation method is the most frequently used assay for examining the internal N-cyling processes in wildland soils. Than the laboratory methods for assessing nitrification are disscused. Nitrification potential has been applied to nitrification rates measurements using a wide variety of laboratory techniques. Ntrification potentials determined by the shaken slurry method may be the easiest to interpret and most reproducible of all laboratory nitrification assays.},

abstract = {Recent research in estuaries challenges the longstanding paradigm of the gravitationally driven estuarine circulation. In estuaries with relatively strong tidal forcing and modest buoyancy forcing, the tidal variation in stratification leads to a tidal straining circulation driven by tidal variation in vertical mixing, with a magnitude that may significantly exceed the gravitational circulation. For weakly stratified estuaries, vertical and lateral advection are also important contributors to the tidally driven residual circulation. The apparent contradiction with the conventional paradigm is resolved when the estuarine parameter space is mapped with respect to a mixing parameter M that is based on the ratio of the tidal timescale to the vertical mixing timescale. Estuaries with high M values exhibit strong tidal nonlinearity, and those with small M values show conventional estuarine dynamics. Estuaries with intermediate mixing rates show marked transitions between these regimes at timescales of the springneap cycle.},

abstract = {Although tropical forests account for only a fraction of the planet's terrestrial surface, they exchange more carbon dioxide with the atmosphere than any other biome on Earth, and thus play a disproportionate role in the global cli- mate. In the next 20 years, the tropics will experience unprecedented warming, yet there is exceedingly high uncer- tainty about their potential responses to this imminent climatic change. Here, we prioritize research approaches given both funding and logistical constraints in order to resolve major uncertainties about how tropical forests func- tion and also to improve predictive capacity of earth system models. We investigate overall model uncertainty of tro- pical latitudes and explore the scientific benefits and inevitable trade-offs inherent in large-scale manipulative field experiments. With a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 analysis, we found that model variability in projected net ecosystem production was nearly 3 times greater in the tropics than for any other latitude. Through a review of the most current literature, we concluded that manipulative warming experiments are vital to accurately predict future tropical forest carbon balance, and we further recommend the establishment of a network of compar- able studies spanning gradients of precipitation, edaphic qualities, plant types, and/or land use change. We provide arguments for long-term, single-factor warming experiments that incorporate warming of the most biogeochemically active ecosystem components (i.e. leaves, roots, soil microbes). Hypothesis testing of underlying mechanisms should be a priority, along with improving model parameterization and constraints. No single tropical forest is representa- tive of all tropical forests; therefore logistical feasibility should be the most important consideration for locating large- scale manipulative experiments. Above all, we advocate for multi-faceted research programs, and we offer arguments for what we consider the most powerful and urgent way forward in order to improve our understanding of tropical forest responses to climate change.},

abstract = {The necessity of fertilizing tef especially with nitrogen (N) has been proven both by nationwide and site-specific fertilizer-rate trials. Phosphorous (P) application is of secondary importance and is recommended at minimum levels of application, except on highly weathered red soils that fix considerable quantity of the applied P. The optiumu rate of n application is 60 Kg ha-1. Applications beyond this rate aggravate lodging, indicating the need for the development of non-lodging varieties. Generally, it has been possible to increase tef grain yield up to 2.5 t ha-1 on research fields and 2 t ha-1 on farmers' fields following improved cultural practices including fertilizer application against the national average of 1 t ha-1. Because the application time of N is largely infuenced by climatic and soil factors, it is difficult to make general recommendations. However, in order to minimize N loss due to leaching or other means, split application where N is applied during the maximum growth period of the crop is recommended; conversely, for lower levels of N, one time application at the appropriate growth stage has been considered a better practice. When tef is grown after legume crop, reducing the rate of N by 50{\%} did not result in any significant yield reduction compared to yield obtained from the recommended dose of N application. The results from other studies that dealt with dry-matter accumulation and nutrient uptake, mycorrhizal and micronutrient relationships in the crop, N-use efficiency of tef varieties, Fe-nutrition and effects of alley cropping are described.},

Here we summarise pair-wise comparisons of inter-reef “shoal grounds”, closed and open to line-fishing, in terms of abundance and lengths of prized sportfish, bycatch and unfished species. The results of paired “fished- unfished” contrasts all depended on the context of microhabitat type, proximity to fishing ports and species vulnerability to line-fishing. On diffuse, low-relief grounds off Townsville prized target species were actually less abundant in zones closed to fishing. On discrete sunken banks of the Capricorn plateau closed to fishing there were about twice as many prized species, and they were larger than conspecifics on fished banks. A positive effect of closure to fishing around the deep bases of reefs in the Pompeys, Swains and Capricorn- Bunkers was visible only in coral-dominated microhabitats. Reef sharks were consistently more abundant in zones closed to fishing. These differences have been communicated with novel point-and-click, map-based BRUVS footage and data summaries on the “e-Atlas”, using Google “Earth” and YouTube. This allows the public to make independent conclusions about the local effects of marine protected areas.},

abstract = {In spite of the importance of phosphorus (P) as a limiting nutrient in terrestrial ecosystems, our understanding of terrestrial P dynamics and our ability to model P cycling are hampered by the lack of consistent measurements of soil P. The Hedley fractionation method provides a comprehen-sive assessment of soil P and has been widely used in recent decades. Here we expand an earlier study that summarized Hedley P data from the literature to create a larger Hedley P database and further investigate the relationships between distributions of different forms of P and the stages of soil de-velopment. Our expanded Hedley P database generally sup-ports what the Walker and Syers (1976) conceptual model predicts: the gradual decrease and eventual depletion of pri-mary mineral P (mainly apatite P); the continual increase and eventual dominance of occluded P; and the overall decrease of total P during soil development. However the analysis dis-agrees with Walker and Syers (1976) in that we found labile inorganic P(Pi) and secondary mineral Pi (non-occluded P in Walker and Syers' model) to be a significant fraction of total P throughout all soil orders with different weathering stages. By analyzing the Hedley-labile P and vegetation P demand, we found that the amount of labile P is much greater than vegetation demand, even in highly weathered soils com-monly considered P limited. We conclude that labile P mea-sured by Hedley fractionation method should not be defined as plant available P since most of this labile P likely ends up as immobilized by microbes. Our analysis of the database also shows that carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil organic matter are closely linked in all soil orders, but P is decoupled Correspondence to: X.

abstract = {Tropical forests contain a large stock of soil carbon, but the factors that constrain its mineralization remain poorly understood. Microorganisms, when stimulated by the presence of new inputs of labile organic carbon, can mineralize ('prime') soil organic matter to acquire nutrients. We used stable carbon isotopes to assess how nutrient demand and soil properties constrain mineralization of added labile (sucrose) carbon and pre-existing (primed) soil carbon in tropical forest soils. In a series of lowland tropical forest soils from Panama, we found that the mineralization of fresh labile carbon was accelerated foremost by phosphorus addition, whereas the mineralization of pre-existing soil carbon was constrained foremost by nitrogen addition. However, there was variation in the relative importance of these nutrients in different soils and the largest effects on the acceleration of sucrose metabolism and constraint of priming occurred following the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus together. The respiration responses due to sucrose or primed soil carbon mineralization were reduced at pH below 4.8 and above 6.0. We conclude that in these tropical forest soils, phosphorus availability is more important in promoting microbial mineralization of sucrose carbon, whereas nitrogen availability is more important in constraining the priming of pre-existing soil organic carbon. This response likely arises because nitrogen is more closely coupled to organic matter cycling, whereas phosphorus is abundant in both organic and inorganic forms. These results suggest that the greatest impact of priming on soil carbon stocks will occur in moderately acidic tropical forest soils of low nitrogen availability. Given long-term changes in both atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen deposition, the impact of priming effects on soil carbon in tropical forest soils may be partially constrained by the abundance of nitrogen.},

abstract = {Tropical montane forests (TMFs) are recognized for the provision of hydrological services and the protection of biodiversity, but their role in carbon storage is not well understood. We synthesized published observations (n=94) of above-ground biomass (AGB) from forest inventory plots in TMFs (defined here as forests between 23.5° N and 23.5° S with elevations ≥1000 m a.s.l.). We found that mean (median) AGB in TMFs is 271 (254) t per hectare of land surface. We demonstrate that AGB declines moderately with both elevation and slope angle but that TMFs store substantial amounts of biomass, both at high elevations (up to 3500 m) and on steep slopes (slope angles of up to 40°). We combined remotely sensed data sets of forest cover with high resolution data of elevation to show that 75{\%} of the global planimetric (horizontal) area of TMF are on steep slopes (slope angles greater than 27°). We used our remote sensed data sets to demonstrate that this prevalence of steep slopes results in the global land surface area of TMF (1.22 million km2) being 40{\%} greater than the planimetric area that is the usual basis for reporting global land surface areas and remotely sensed data. Our study suggests that TMFs are likely to be a greater store of carbon than previously thought, highlighting the need for conservation of the remaining montane forests. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {The structure of the salinity field in northern San Francisco Bay and how it is affected by freshwater flow are discussed. Two datasets are examined: the first is 23 years of daily salinity data taken by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation along the axis of northern San Francisco Bay; the second is a set of salinity transects taken by the U. S. Geological Survey between 1988 and 1993. Central to this paper is a measure of salinity intrusion, X-2 : the distance from the Golden Gate Bridge to where the bottom salinity is 2 psu. Using X-2 to scale distance, the authors find that for most flow conditions, the mean salinity distribution of the estuary is nearly self-similar with a salinity gradient in the center 70{\%} of the region between the Golden Gate and X-2 that is proportional to X-2(-1). Analysis of covariability of Q and X-2 showed a characteristic timescale of adjustment of the salinity field of approximately 2 weeks. The steady-state response deduced from the X-2 time series implies that X-2 is proportional to riverflow to the 1/7 power. This relation, which differs from the standard 1/3 power dependence that is derived theoretically assuming constant exchange coefficients, shows that the upstream salt flux associated with gravitational circulation is more sensitive to the longitudinal salinity gradient than theory supposes. This is attributed to the strengthening of stratification caused by the stronger longitudinal salinity gradient that accompanies larger river flows.},

abstract = {Tropical tree height-diameter (H:D) relationships may vary by forest type and region making large-scale estimates of above-ground biomass subject to bias if they ignore these differences in stem allometry. We have therefore developed a new global tropical forest database consisting of 39 955 concurrent H and D measurements encompassing 283 sites in 22 tropical countries. Utilising this database, our objectives were: 1. to determine if H:D relationships differ by geographic region and forest type (wet to dry forests, including zones of tension where forest and savanna overlap). 2. to ascertain if the H:D relationship is modulated by climate and/or forest structural characteristics (e.g. stand-level basal area, A). 3. to develop H:D allometric equations and evaluate biases to reduce error in future local-to-global estimates of tropical forest biomass. Annual precipitation coefficient of variation (P-V), dry season length (S-D), and mean annual air temperature (T-A) emerged as key drivers of variation in H:D relationships at the pantropical and region scales. Vegetation structure also played a role with trees in forests of a high A being, on average, taller at any given D. After the effects of environment and forest structure are taken into account, two main regional groups can be identified. Forests in Asia, Africa and the Guyana Shield all have, on average, similar H:D relationships, but with trees in the forests of much of the Amazon Basin and tropical Australia typically being shorter at any given D than their counterparts elsewhere. The region-environment-structure model with the lowest Akaike's information criterion and lowest deviation estimated stand-level H across all plots to within a median -2.7 to 0.9{\%} of the true value. Some of the plot-to-plot variability in H:D relationships not accounted for by this model could be attributed to variations in soil physical conditions. Other things being equal, trees tend to be more slender in the absence of soil physical constraints, especially at smaller D. Pantropical and continental-level models provided less robust estimates of H, especially when the roles of climate and stand structure in modulating H:D allometry were not simultaneously taken into account.},

abstract = {To investigate the storage relationships between and production of organic matter in tropical forests and climate, data on forest biomass, soil organic matter, litter storage, primary production, and litterfall were surveyed from the literature and organized using the Holdridge Life Zone system of classification. Ordinary least squares regressions were applied to all the data sets using the ratio of temperature to precipitation (T/P) as an index to climate and the independent variable. Total forest biomass (40-538 t/ha) gave a significant inverted U-shaped relationship with T/P, with peak values in the tropical moist forest life zone and lower ones in wetter and drier forest life zones. Soil carbon content (24-599 t C/ha) decreased exponentially and significantly with increasing T/P (i.e., from wet to dry forest life zones). No significant relationship was found between litter storage and T/P. Gross primary production (19-120 t/ha yr) decreased exponentially and significantly with increasing T/P. Neither net primary production (11-21 t/ha yr) nor wood production (1-11 t/ha yr) were related to T/P. The ratio of leaf litter production to net primary production (0.25-0.65) was inversely related to T/P, suggesting different strategies of allocation of the net primary production in different life zones. The relationship between total litterfall (1.0-15.3 t/ha yr, excluding large wood) and T/P was significant and its shape similar to that obtained for biomass versus T/P; litterfall was highest in tropical moist forest life zones and lower in wetter or drier ones. The linear relationship between biomass and litterfall suggested that the turnover time of biomass in mature tropical forests is similar for all life zones, and is of the order of 34 yr. To determine the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle, literature estimates of areas of tropical forests were placed into six life zone groupings. The total tropical and subtropical basal and altitudinal forest area of 1838 million ha was comprised of 42 percent dry forest, 33 percent moist forest, and 25 percent wet and rain forest life zone groups. Organic-matter storage data were also combined into the six life zone groups and the means for each group calculated. The product of forest areas in the six groups and the mean organic matter per unit area in the groups yielded a total storage of 787 billion t organic matter, with vegetation accounting for 58, soils 41, and litter 1 percent. About half of the total storage was located in the tropical basal wet, moist, and dry forest life zone groups. Litterfall data were treated in the same way as organic-matter storage, resulting in a total litter production in tropical forests of 12.3 billion t organic matter/yr. Most litter was produced in the tropical basal moist forest group (30{\%}) and least in the tropical basal dry forest group (10{\%}). Turnover time of litter in tropical forests was less than 1 yr. Lowest turnover times were in very wet (1 yr) and in dry (0.9-1.9 yr) life zone groups. Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle because they store 46 percent of the world's living terrestrial carbon pool and 11 percent of the world's soil carbon pool.},

abstract = {Summary-Nitrogen transformations were measured in soil from 33 sites arranged in I5 classes in five tropical areas. Sites sampled included forests on fertile volcanic and sedimentary soils, infertile oxisols and ultisols, extremely infertile white-sand soils, montane sites, and a primary and a secondary successional sere. In comparison with temperate forests, net N mineralization and nitrification were rapid in intact lowland tropical forests (other than white sands) and microbial lJN uptake was relatively slow. In contrast, white-sand and upper montane sites had lower rates of mineralization and nitrification and greater microbial immobilization of “N; N could be in short supply in many such sites. These patterns of N transformations reinforce inferences about soil N supply based on patterns of litterfall N in tropical forests.},

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. 2. Species sorting (i.e. species are ‘filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmen- tally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by ‘mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this differ- ence may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. 3. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. 4. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

abstract = {Observed atmospheric concentrations of CO(2) and data on the partial pressures of CO(2) in surface ocean waters are combined to identify globally significant sources and sinks of CO(2). The atmospheric data are compared with boundary layer concentrations calculated with the transport fields generated by a general circulation model (GCM) for specified source-sink distributions. In the model the observed north-south atmospheric concentration gradient can be maintained only if sinks for CO(2) are greater in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere. The observed differences between the partial pressure of CO(2) in the surface waters of the Northern Hemisphere and the atmosphere are too small for the oceans to be the major sink of fossil fuel CO(2). Therefore, a large amount of the CO(2) is apparently absorbed on the continents by terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {The conference 'Fish Sampling with Active Methods' (FSAM) was held in September 2010 in Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic. A total of 108 participants from 29 countries attended the meeting and 100 lectures and posters were presented. The meeting brought together scientist working with an interesting combination of techniques for investigation of fish populations in seas, lakes, reservoirs and rivers (mostly hydroacoustics, trawling, electric fishing, comparison of active methods with the use of gillnets and use of visual approaches). In contrast to passive methods, active methods can be used to measure absolute fish abundance because the sampling volume can be defined and estimated. If fish welfare precautions are applied, active methods can be less destructive than passive. But there is still a need for using combinations of multiple sampling methods and for improved understanding of gear efficiency, scrutinizing the efficiency through independent methods or by studying of variation in sampling efficiency due to the robustness of the sampling strategy (comparing the nets of different dimensions, mesh sizes, speed etc.). ?? 2011.},

abstract = {This study presents an approach for the determination of the trophic parameters Secchi disk transparency and chlorophyll-a from hyperspectral airborne casi and HyMap data with multitemporal validity. Based on in situ water sampling and reflectance measurements, algorithms have been developed. For Secchi disk transparency, the area between a base line and the spectrum from 400 to 750 nm was calculated and correlated to the Secchi disk transparency measured in situ; chlorophyll-a concentration was quantified using the existing reflectance ratio at 705 and 678 nm, which showed a linear relationship to chlorophyll-a concentration from laboratory spectrophotometric measurements. The algorithms have been adapted to the spectral characteristics of the airborne sensors and applied to these data recorded in September 1997 and 1998 and May and June 1999. The validation using independent in situ reference data showed mean standard errors of 1.2-1.3 m for Secchi disk transparency and of 10.2-10.9 ??g/l chlorophyll-a. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

@article{Ladd1996,
abstract = {Comparisons have been made of the recoveries and distributions of total and isotope-labelled microbial biomass C and organic C and N in particle-size fractions of a Vertisol and an Alfisol decomposing 14C, 15N-labelled glucose/NH4; and of the Vertisol decomposing labelled legume and wheat residues. Recoveries after fractionation of soil weight, and of labelled organic C and N and biomass C, were high ({\textgreater} 96{\%}) in most treatments. In both the strongly-aggregated Vertisol and the weakly-aggregated Alfisol, each amended with 14C-glucose/15N-NH4 and incubated for 3 days, the bimodal patterns of distribution of residual organic 14C and of biomass 14C were very similar to each other and to that of native biomass C. Major proportions of residual organic 14C and biomass 14C were located with the fine silt-size (20-2 ??m) fraction, which, in the Vertisol under the conditions of soil dispersion, was dominated by clay microaggregates. A minor peak of residual organic 14C and biomass 14C was located in the fine sand-size (250-50 ??m) fraction from both soils. Residual organic 15N was similarly bimodally-distributed. Nevertheless, the clay-size (2-0.1 ??m) fraction of both soils accounted for higher proportions of organic 15N than of organic 14C, and in the case of the Alfisol, higher proportions of organic 14C than of biomass 14C. The relatively large differences in the cation exchange capacities of the clay- and fine silt-size components of the almost fully-dispersed Alfisol, in contrast to the similar cation exchange capacities of these size fractions in the partially-dispersed Vertisol, are considered to be contributory factors to the differences between the soils in residual 14C and 15N distributions. The more evident partial separation of biomass 14C, organic 14C and organic 15N in the fine particle size fractions of the Alfisol than in those of the Vertisol is thought to have arisen from the greater opportunities in the former soil for metabolic turnover and preferential adsorption of exocellular nitrogenous organics to its clay-size than its silt-size constituents. However, the cation exchange capacity of fractions was not the sole factor determining residue distribution throughout the total size-range of the fractions. Expressed as concentrations on a fraction CEC basis, organic 14C, biomass 14C and organic 15N were most concentrated in the coarse sand-size ({\textgreater} 250 ??m) fraction of both soils (probably from the association of the labelled microbial residues with partly degraded plant fragments). In the cases of the Vertisol amended with 14C, 15N-labelled legume or wheat materials and incubated for 49 days, the distribution patterns of labelled organic residues were very similar to those respectively from the glucose/NN4-amended Vertisol. The main exception was that the sand-size fractions from the plant residue-amended Vertisols were relatively enriched with total organic 14C, due very probably to the persistence of some undecomposed plant constituents. Both the similarities and differences in the distributions of labelled organic 14C and 15N and biomass 14C in soil particle-size fractions have been related to the influence of substrate and soil properties and of incubation time on the extent of decomposition of primary substrates and of C and N turnover. Broadly, the results suggest that there is a widespread and somewhat uniform early response of the soil microflora to a soluble substrate such as glucose and NH4, i.e the distribution of the new growth (and of immobilized 14C and 15N) within the soil matrix was strongly determined by the location of the existing microflora. For plant residue substrates (after an incubation period sufficient to allow turnover of the relatively unprotected components of biomass 14C), the distributions within particle-size fractions of labelled biomass and immobilized 15N were also broadly similar to that of native biomass C. In such circumstances, the distributions of biomass C and 14C in the fractions were probably determined by factors of substrate supply and protection from predation within the unfractionated soil matrix; factors which appeared to be unrelated to fraction CEC.},
